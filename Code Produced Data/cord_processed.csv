searches,,advances in technology have increased the speed and reduced the cost of dna sequencing this has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of sequences contributed by both large sequencing centres and individual laboratories to sequence databases public biological sequence databases are growing at an ever increasing rate with 9 million new sequences being added to genbank from august 2002 to august 2003 alone 1 currently the genbank database has almost 42 billion nucleotides from over 32 million sequences the number of whole genome sequences of eukaryotes prokaryotes and viruses is also increasing rapidly accordingly tools like ncbi blast which search those databases for sequences similar to a given query sequence return larger and larger sets of results sequence similarity searching is a powerful tool to help develop testable hypotheses in the quest to characterize genes and other dna sequences and infer structural functional or evolutionary relationships researchers interested in identifying new matches to query sequences which may be a few genes or even whole genomes must search through massive amounts of alignment data to retrieve new and interesting matches in order to keep up with the growing databases the researcher must submit the same queries periodically however the new results no matter how significant are often buried in a long list of results that were previously obtained on past searches rehab ( recent hits acquired from blast ) is a new software package that was developed to address these problems rehab performs psi blast 2 searches of a protein sequence database and keeps a database of all significant alignments ( hits ) obtained these searches are performed on a regular schedule against updated versions of the sequence database it then compares the sequences in the new psi blast result with the rehab hits database to identify new matches resulting from recently deposited sequences the complete rehab hits database can then be queried by date using a simple gui to allow the researcher to easily identify new hits these are highlighted and pairwise or multiple alignments can be performed to assess the quality of the match as well as filtering out results that have been found previously the rehab browser can filter out hits against sequences that are identical to the sequences being submitted as queries ( such as orthologs of the query sequence ) rehab is designed to be a practical tool for searching ncbi database updates with large numbers of query sequences for example our laboratory uses it with all open reading frames ( orfs ) from fully sequenced poxvirus genomes ( over 7000 query sequences ) as the number of sequenced virus genomes continues to increase the number of hypothetical orfs of unknown function also expands this is particularly true for large viruses like poxviruses baculoviruses and herpesviruses that possess many virulence genes that are not part of the core set of genes that define a virus family 3 there are also numerous core genes for which no known function has yet been identified for example of 49 completely conserved protein families in poxviruses there are 11 with completely unknown function and at least 5 others with only poorly defined function other programs have been previously created to deal with this particular issue including dbwatcher 4 seals 5 swiss shop 6 sequence alerting system 7 and blast search updater 8 however www based programs are not well suited to searching with large numbers of query sequences and there may be concerns with a shut down of service ( as occurred with sequence alerting system ) or allowing proprietary data out of a secure network other programs may be complicated to use or require users to directly interact with unix operating systems rehab is specifically designed for searching with large numbers of query sequences and can support a number of research groups it also provides a user friendly graphical interface the client will run on most major operating systems including mac os x windows linux and solaris rehab was implemented for the java platform to simplify the support of multiple operating systems including linux microsoft windows solaris and mac os x users initially access and launch the application ( client ) from a web page using java web start which also automatically downloads updated versions as they become available this ensures users are taking advantage of improvements or added features in the latest software version furthermore coding in java allows interoperability with existing applications developed in our laboratory including base by base 9 our choice was reinforced by past successes with the java platform and java web start for implementation and distribution of programs such as vocs 10 vgo 11 and base by base 9 rehab consists of four main components ( figure 1 ) ( 1 ) a mysql relational database that stores information about hits including biological sequences alignments between them and other categorization and annotation data ( 2 ) a java server that provides access to programs which cannot be run locally by the client on arbitrary user workstations such as ncbi blast and emboss 12 utilities ( 3 ) a java swing graphical client downloaded and launched on client machines using java web start ( 4 ) and a back end java program which runs alignment programs and compiles results in the database each of these components is described in more detail below although all components can be run on a single machine it is envisioned that a single server will support a variety of users dispersed on an intranet or the internet if required it is simple to offload the batch database searching to a more powerful cluster or grid system there are four types of information stored in the rehab database ( 1 ) biological sequences and their annotations both those used as queries in blast searches and those which have been returned as hit subjects ( 2 ) information on each query / subject pair ( hit ) gathered from individual search results and alignment programs ( including bit score date entered and percent identity ) ( 3 ) organizing information such as which query sequences belong to which organisms and ( 4 ) other caching information used to speed performance of server side program functions to reduce the amount of required storage space actual alignments are not stored but are regenerated for presentation when the user selects the specific query sequence or query target pair to be viewed query sequences which are entered using a simple fasta like format that includes additional annotation information in the identifying line need only be submitted once to rehab since they are stored for future search cycles the work of running psi blast searches is done in batch mode by the ncbi blastpgp program against a local copy of the ncbi non redundant ( nr ) protein database psi blast is performed for three iterations without filtering procedures ( such as for low complexity regions ) hits with an e value less than 0 001 are used to generate the scoring matrix for the subsequent cycle to increase speed searches with query sequences that result in no new hits are terminated after the first cycle those with new hits scoring below the threshold continue to the third cycle psi blast was chosen because it is a more sensitive search method than blastp the searches do not need to be performed on the same machine on which the database or server components are installed xml output from blastpgp is parsed and relevant information about each hit is stored in the rehab database in addition to scores and identifying information target sequences are copied into the rehab database to ensure that they are available for analysis in the future even if they are no longer available from ncbi this is important because although ncbi does not actually remove sequences from its database it may change the identifier of a sequence if it is corrected updated or merged with another identical entry any changes to a pre existing entry are added to the database but it is not registered as a new hit the server component consists of java rmi classes that provide remote access to local facilities and a loading program that registers those classes with an rmi registry installed on the server from which the client will be downloaded requirement for the server is a system that can support java 1 4 1 and mysql 4 0 the java swing client component allows a user to browse the information collected in the database by the back end program when the client is downloaded and launched from a website it connects to the server and database specified in its configuration file the client program visually presents summary information about hits added to the database and allows the user to quickly locate new relevant hits and the sequences involved there are five main views available in the client ( 1 ) the management console lists the available databases and has options for creating new databases or adding files to existing databases ( 2 ) the hits browser window lists the organisms for which query sequences have been added in the database and allows users to select filtering and highlighting options ( 3 ) a hits summary which displays the results in a table with highlighting to mark new hits and ( 4 ) an html output or ( 5 ) a hits manager that displays detailed information about retrieved sequences and alignments rehab is a tool that works with blast to identify new hits in updated versions of sequence databases it allows the researcher to ask the question what new sequences match my sequences since the last time i searched in the example of our work the query sequences are all the orfs of the fully sequenced poxvirus genomes ( 36 genomes 7075 query sequences ) these sequences are used to query the nr ncbi protein database and a mysql database of all hits is generated and stored ( figure 2 ) databases of hits for other virus families maintained by the virus bioinformatics resource ( tvbr herpesviruses baculoviruses coronaviruses and adenoviruses ) will also be available in the near future the hits database can then be accessed by double clicking on the database name or by selecting browse by organism in the action menu this opens a new window to present browsing sorting and highlighting options ( figure 3 ) the user can browse by organism name such as variola virus strain bangladesh 1975 to highlight recent hits the date option is chosen to define the date after which the hits are considered new the available dates are those on which the query sequences were searched against a then current nr ncbi database the output can be sorted based on three criteria ( name new hit date or maximum new hit bit score ) by selecting the appropriate radio button the results are presented in a new window using colors to indicate new hits ( figure 4 ) since all new hits are not necessarily significant results are highlighted in different colors depending on the bit score the user can change the default threshold of the minimum bit score to show new hits scoring above this cut off in red and new hits scoring below it in yellow since all query sequences that have new hits are highlighted any that remain unhighlighted do not have new hits however unhighlighted queries may have significant hits from previous searches the latest hit column indicates this fact query sequences showing hits only from previous searches show an older hit date and a bit score of 0 in the new hit score column unhighlighted sequences with no information in the latest hit column do not have any hits in the database or they have been filtered out ( see below ) information about the hits can be viewed in two ways selecting html report launches the users default web browser and displays the hit list in familiar blast style ( figure 5a ) hits are displayed in descending order of bit score however a key feature of this program is that new hits are highlighted in red or yellow the pairwise alignment can be displayed rapidly by clicking on the score ( a hyperlink ) in contrast to the usual blast output which presents the local alignment found by blast a global alignment produced by needle 1213 is shown more information can be obtained about the target sequence by clicking on the link to the ncbi file for that entry alternatively a full list of hits can be viewed in the hits manager window ( figure 5b ) here sequences can be sorted by highlight and pairwise or multiple alignments can be performed pairwise alignments are displayed by selecting a single target sequence and clicking the global button for global alignments produced by the emboss program needle or the local button for local alignments generated by the emboss program water 1214 multiple alignments are generated by selecting more than one target sequence and clicking the base by base button the software automatically retrieves the appropriate sequences from the rehab hits database performs a clustalw alignment and passes the resulting multiple alignment to base by base which functions as an alignment viewer and editor 9 finally sequences in the hits manager can be viewed in fasta format by clicking the show button and can be copied from this window using standard keystrokes unless a sequence has not been deposited in the public database a sequence similarity search will return results including the query sequence itself as well as nearly identical sequences that are orthologs of the query rehab can block the highlighting of hit sequences that are also present in the query database when the dont show my own sequences option is selected such sequences will not be shown or highlighted in the hits results window however these sequences and their alignments with the query can still be visualized in the html report and hits manager windows thus allowing the user to access all the available information this feature becomes essential when new poxvirus genomes are added to the public database since a large fraction of the queries will hit proteins in the new genome and signal a new hit report when there may be no other new hits in the database although these are clearly high scoring matches they are expected and therefore must be masked in the analysis if the full value of rehab is to be realized in the browser window ( figure 3 ) the user can chose to browse by the annotation included in each sequences information line in the case of our poxvirus sequences useful annotations are organism name and protein family ( as determined in pocs 10 ) selecting an item from the group by annotation list loads the new category in the list on the left side of the window this sorting allows the user to quickly find query sequences of particular interest for example one may be interested in looking at only sequences from the ankyrin family results can then be viewed and analyzed as described above researchers can use rehab to search databases with their own set of query sequences in the example of our research it is most practical to organize the query sequences by organism and protein family other researchers however may find other naming schemes to be more useful no changes to the program or database are required for example a research group could organize query sequences and the hits results databases by laboratory name and browsing of results could be by the researchers name ( figure 6 ) individual laboratory members would add query sequences to the database including their name in the identifying information line in this example the laboratory name would replace virus family and user names would replace organism names all query sequences would be searched in the same batch process and each individual could then browse their sequences of interest users interested in establishing their own rehab database should contact the authors for assistance the goal of this project was to build a software package to aid in the identification of new results returned from sequence similarity searches to this end we developed rehab a tool that highlights new hits by comparing results from previously run searches to those with a recently updated database rehab allows researchers to query the nr protein database with large numbers of sequences and can highlight sort and analyze results in a user friendly graphical interface it can also be used to rapidly create multiple alignments with any set of sequences returned by a blast search this enables researchers to recognize new significant sequence matches in the mass of results generated by high throughput database search protocols

lgcmamfb,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC549583/,"nicoletta dentico, nathan ford",the courage to change the rules a proposal for an essential health r d treaty,,until recently providing patent protection for pharmaceuticals was a choice made by individual governments according to their level of industrial development today pharmaceutical patents are globalized through the world trade organizations agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights ( trips agreement ) 4 and then further reinforced through bilateral and regional arrangements ( the so called trips plus agreements 5 ) but the patent system stimulates innovation only where industry sees the opportunity for increasing sales and market share much of the resulting innovation is in fact imitation producing me too drugs that offer little if anything in the way of therapeutic benefit over existing drugs ( box 1 ) the poorest are hardest hit while r d of new therapies against tropical diseases has ground to a standstill 14 million people die from infectious diseases each year predominantly in developing countries 1 most of the worlds 40 million people with hiv / aids including 2 2 million children under 15 live in the developing world ( www unaids org ) the poor also dominate non communicable disease tables accounting for 59 of the 56 5 million annual global deaths 6 the patent system is also promoting new inequalities in high income countries americans now spend a staggering $ 200 billion a year on prescription drugs this figure is growing at a rate of about 12 per year 7 the average price of the fifty drugs most used by senior citizens in america was nearly $ 1500 for a years supply in 2002 prescription drugs have become inaccessible even to many people in the rich world patents with their focus on maximizing profits have at least three negative consequences first it has been argued that the patent system causes substantial welfare losses because consumers who would buy the product if it were priced at somewhere nearer production cost do not buy it at the monopoly price 8 second the system encourages counterfeiting counterfeit drugs may represent up to 10 of the global market for pharmaceuticals 9 third patented drugs are promoted through excessive marketing on average twice as much is spent on marketing a drug as on its r d 10 across industries it is becoming increasingly apparent that the patent system isnt working well 11 leading some in industry to express public concern that the blockbuster business model is irreparably broken 12 a new approach is needed for all our sakes the only major international policy instrument that exists today to stimulate and finance health r d is the trips agreement 4 the trips agreement provides 20 years of patent protection on pharmaceuticals in the hope of stimulating the development of new medicines beyond that governments try to stimulate r d in neglected areas by providing industry with incentives such as tax breaks and patent extensions however the effectiveness of these policies is hardly known in 2001 the doha declaration on trips and public health affirmed the sovereign right of wto members to take measures to protect public health by overcoming patents whenever needed 4 the last few years have seen increased attention to the fact that patents keep drug costs high and limit access to medicines however there has been no movement in international policy to address the crisis in pharmaceutical innovation health r d must be treated as an international problem that requires an international solution it should be treated like other strategic sectors as happens today for defense and space discovery sectors that both benefit from very strong government support for innovation when global public goods do correspond to national needs governments should step in to mobilize and enforce the collective action required for example global cooperation in the sharing of infectious disease monitoring from 1890 onwards set a valuable precedent 13 the recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars clearly shows that biomedical knowledge and the pharmaceutical sciences can be mobilized to achieve rapid advances relevant to social needs if sufficient resources and political will can be mustered the sars virus was completely sequenced in just six days and a diagnostic test was developed in only three months the public sector funded collaborative public goods model used for the human genome project shows that public collaborative research can be more efficient than the closed monopolistic private sector approach an international treaty ( box 2 ) would promote a health needs driven approach to drug discovery the elaboration of such a treaty would have to meet the two crucial requirements for an effective system of funding innovation in pharmaceuticals first the reward for innovation should be proportional to the social ( that is therapeutic ) value second prices should be near average production cost the idea is to shift the discourse from trade to health the treaty focussed directly on r d rather than patent rights or drug prices would address the global management of publicly funded health r d priorities for r d would be defined through public sector leadership and based on public health needs r d opportunities would be aimed at new lead compounds new types of health tools ( figure 2 ) and new treatment approaches as the only legally mandated international government agency responsible for global health the world health organization should work toward establishing this essential r d agenda individual states would need to periodically evaluate targets for priority research and make adequate recommendations toward needs driven r d one of the main objectives of the treaty would be to encourage the broad dissemination of information and knowledge sharing and to support diversity competition and collaboration among researchers from developed and developing countries there are already precedents for the free public sharing of innovations with the aim of developing new drugs the tropical diseases initiative ( www tropicaldisease org ) for example is a new internet based community wide effort to develop new drugs for tropical diseases 14 the biobricks project ( http / / parts mit edu / ) at the massachusetts institute of technology is exploring standardized tools and processes for dna work largely by computer the bios initiative ( biological innovation for open society ) launched by the australian non profit organization cambia ( the center for the application of molecular biology to international agriculture www cambia org ) is an effort to develop new innovation systems for market failures and for neglected priorities 15 among other incentives technology exchange frameworks could include licensing agreements with developing countries or affirmative commitments of research funds for collaborative projects with these countries such collaboration is currently being implemented in europe for example through the european and developing countries clinical trial partnership ( www edctp org ) 16 the partnership is a new funding body established to fund research in developing countries particularly in africa which contributes to the development of affordable prophylactics and drugs for hiv / aids tuberculosis and malaria the treaty on health r d should also promote partnerships between countries in the developing world and encourage the creation of regional technology networks in developing countries much of todays drug development know how exists within the private sector further work is needed to define obligations and incentives in the treaty that maximize industry contributions to publicly funded r d by providing in kind contributions in areas where industry has the skills that public groups need the treaty should also provide an expanded use of government rights against patent abuse on drugs developed with public support this would include the right of a government to intervene if an invention is not made available to the public on reasonable terms such as is included in the march in rights clause of the united statess 1980 bayh dole act ( which enabled public universities to license inventions for commercial development 17 ) there are a number of obvious difficulties in moving the treaty forward and these should not be underestimated a delicate issue is the treatys relation with other binding agreements particularly the trips agreement governments that join the treaty should be granted patent exceptions and should not be accused of free riding since they would be contributing to r d through a different juridical avenue substantial government resources would need to be mobilized to finance the highest priority medical research all governments should participate according to their means countries already contribute significantly to global r d through the purchase of costly patented drugs among other measures not for profit initiatives working to develop new drugs vaccines and diagnostic tools for neglected diseases should be funded at levels that enable them to reach their objectives recent examples clearly show that when political will is mobilized resources are rapidly made available to generate r d in a particular area in 2001 the anthrax scare in the us led to increases in biodefense research spending at the us national institutes of health from us $ 53 million in 2001 to us $ 1 6 billion in 2004 a treaty on health r d is certainly a feasible proposal the successful adoption of a treaty on plant genetic resources shows that it can be done after seven years of negotiations the food and agriculture organization of the united nations adopted the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture in november 2001 18 this legally binding treaty covers all plant genetic resources relevant for food and agriculture through the treaty countries agree to establish an efficient effective and transparent multilateral system to facilitate access to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and to share the benefits in a fair and equitable way while there has been a growing consensus in development circles that more international public goods need to be supplied as part of the development strategy increasing their provision will be influenced by the extent to which inspirational groups of individuals step in to play a leadership role to meet the collective need the ottawa convention to ban anti personnel landmines and the 2003 framework convention on tobacco control show that international frameworks are essential to the regulation of the private sector for the good of global health the world health organization together with other relevant united nations agencies has full legitimacy to work with member states toward crafting challenging proposals and provoking policy action one lesson from these treaties is that support will have to be built from a strong coalition of like minded countries that would steer the process internationally while the development of the treaty is still at an early stage of discussion the concept is already being aggressively opposed as with tobacco landmines and more recently sugar the involvement of civil society will be crucial to defend these health improvement strategies where these may conflict with powerful vested interests in the private sector 19 it takes courage to change the rules if governments are indeed persuaded to face up to their responsibilities in the coming years it may very well be because of the many voluntary organisations that seek to promote the global public interest,

sibbald",sars transmission pattern in singapore reassessed by viral sequence variation analysis,,during infectious disease outbreaks due to either new or established agents extensive information gathering is required to enable identification of the source transmission routes and the effect of containment policies it is becoming increasingly clear that traditional approaches based on travel and contact tracing are not sufficient for tracking an outbreak new sequence based techniques for pathogen detection and identification have the potential to become perhaps the most important component of these investigations as demonstrated in the recent worldwide effort in fighting the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) the discovery of the sars coronavirus ( sars cov ) as the etiological agent for sars was a major breakthrough 1 which was quickly followed by the successful sequencing of the whole genome of the virus 23 genome sequence comparison between this new coronavirus and the three known classes of coronavirus revealed a similar genome structure but minimum homology at the amino acid level strongly suggesting that the sars cov was a new class of coronavirus 234 a comparative sequence analysis of 14 sars isolates from different countries suggested a moderate genetic diversity among the sars isolates and thus implied a slow evolution of the sars cov genome 5 furthermore sequence variation analyses of sars cov isolates demonstrated that common genetic variations in the sars cov genome could be used as molecular fingerprints to partition the viral isolates into different genetic lineages track the transmission of a specific viral lineage and infer the origin of infection 56 therefore the characterization of sars covs genetic variations is not only instrumental for understanding its genetic diversity and genome evolution but also important for tracking its transmission and understanding its epidemiological pattern in human populations direct sequence analysis of a pathogen in a large number of clinical samples particularly at a population level is generally cumbersome technically challenging and expensive therefore a rapid sensitive high throughput and cost effective screening method would greatly facilitate large scale characterization of genetic variation of pathogens at a population level a mass spectrometry ( ms ) based method for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms has been routinely used as a high throughput method for genotyping human samples and thus we sought to extend this methodology to detect pathogen sequence variations here we demonstrate the high sensitivity of the ms based analysis in detecting sars cov sequence variations and apply it to analyzing both cultured viral isolates and uncultured tissue samples of sars cov the sars cov samples used in the sensitivity study were previously described 7 briefly five in vitro samples were generated by spiking 200 l human whole blood samples with sars cov virus obtained from a vero e6 cell culture of an anonymous singapore patient vero cell cultured viral isolates were obtained from 13 singapore patients the presumed index case ( patient sin2500 ) of the singapore sars outbreak whose date of illness onset was 25 february 2004 three primary contacts ( patients sin2677 sin2774 and sin2748 ) whose dates of onset were 9 march 2004 ( sin2677 and sin2774 ) and 14 march 2004 ( sin2748 ) one secondary contact ( patient sin2679 ) who was believed to have contracted sars from index patient sin2500 through another primary contact not included in this study and whose date of illness onset was 15 march 2004 and another eight patients ( sin842 sin845 sin846 sin847 sin848 sin849 sin850 and sin852 ) who were believed to be the fifth or six generation contacts of index patient sin2500 ( based on contact tracing records ) and whose dates of illness onset ranged from 2 april to 14 april 2004 all the patients fitted the world health organization case definition for probable sars 8 the virus was cultured in vero cells following isolation from respiratory samples ( three endotracheal tube swabs three throat swabs one nasal swab two nasopharyngeal aspirates and four lung tissues ) obtained from the patients between 0 and 11 d after onset of symptoms uncultured lung tissue samples were also obtained from patients sin842 sin848 sin849 and sin852 bronchoalveolar lavage material was obtained from a serologically confirmed german patient with sars who had been traveling on the same flight as an early singaporean patient with sars who was later hospitalized in germany 9 virus could not be isolated from the sample owing to its inappropriate storage for the spiked human blood samples rna was extracted from 200 l of blood into 50 l of water using a highpure rna kit ( roche basel switzerland ) for the clinical samples rna was extracted into 30 l of water using a qiamp viral rna mini kit ( qiagen valencia california united states ) rna samples were reverse transcribed into cdna using 2 l of rna as template a superscript kit ( invitrogen carlsbad california united states ) and 13 sequence specific primers 10 all cdna products were purified by ethanol precipitation and then resuspended in 20 l of water real time quantitative pcr analyses of the rna samples from spiked human blood were performed using a lightcycler sars cov quantification kit ( roche ) each analysis was done using 1 l of rna and in accordance with the manufacturers instructions twenty one single nucleotide variations ( snvs ) of sars cov were analyzed in this study eight of these were identified from our previous sequence analysis of five singapore sars cov viral isolates and represent variations 5 and 13 snvs were identified from a more recent genome sequence analysis of additional singapore sars cov viral isolates the former eight snvs were used in evaluating the sensitivity of ms based genotyping analysis in detecting sars cov viral genotypes and the later 13 snvs as well as five of the former eight snvs were used to genotype the patient derived samples a primer extension genotyping assay was designed for each sars cov snv using spectrodesigner software ( sequenom san diego california united states ) and analyzed using the massarray system ( sequenom ) and the recommended protocol for the madli tof ( matrix assisted laser desorption ionization / time of flight ) ms based genotyping analysis 11 one microliter of cdna ( equivalent to 0 1 l of rna from 1 l of spiked human blood ) was used as template in each analysis the analytical detection limit of the combined rna preparation / rt pcr / maldi tof ms system was determined by probit analysis 12 using the statgraphics plus 5 0 software package ( statistical graphics jena germany ) prior to determining viral sequence variants in clinical samples we measured the sensitivity of the ms based assay for detecting sars cov sequence variations by analyzing eight snvs in in vitro human blood samples spiked with sars cov the viral rna copy numbers in five spiked human blood samples were quantified by real time pcr analysis and determined to be 1 64 106 ( sb1 ) 3 84 103 ( sb2 ) 2 17 103 ( sb3 ) 6 21 102 ( sb4 ) and 1 20 102 ( sb5 ) copies per microliter ( figure s1 ) the three samples ( sb3 sb4 and sb5 ) with the lowest virus copy numbers were used to determine the sensitivity of the ms based assay we were able to successfully type the virus in 16 of the 16 analyses of the sb3 sample ( equivalent to 217 rna copies per reaction ) 12 of the 15 analyses of the sb4 sample ( equivalent to 62 rna copies per reaction ) and six of the 15 analyses of the sb5 sample ( equivalent to 12 rna copies per reaction ) according to probit analysis this corresponds to a 95 probability of detection when at least 75 copies of viral rna ( 95 confidence interval 59 107 copies ) are present per reaction and still a 50 detection chance at 38 copies of virus rna per reaction ( 95 confidence interval 29 53 copies ) all 64 sham spiked samples gave negative genotype calls having demonstrated the high sensitivity of the ms based analysis we typed 18 sars cov snvs in the cultured viral isolates from nine singapore patients including five early singapore cases ( sin2500 sin2774 sin2748 sin2677 and sin2679 ) and four later singapore cases ( sin842 sin848 sin849 and sin852 ) of the 18 snvs analyzed nine were detected in at least two sars isolates ( table 1 ) assuming that a common sequence variation originated through a single mutation in a host and was then propagated by subsequent infection to others the sharing of a specific sequence variant by different viral isolates suggests that either these viral isolates share a common ancestor or they have direct ancestor descendant relationship sequence variants at the nine common snv sites were used to reconstruct the molecular relationship among the nine viral isolates the pattern of the shared variants among the nine viral isolates ( table 1 ) clearly indicated two major molecular lineages of isolate ( figure 1 ) one lineage includes the four early isolates from patients sin2500 sin2774 sin2748 and sin2677 and the other includes the early isolate from patient sin2679 and the four later isolates the first lineage is defined by the sequence variant t c t at snv positions19084 23174 and 28268 whereas the second lineage is defined by the sequence variant c t c both the variants are distinct from the presumed ancestral sequence variant c c c observed in the urbani viral isolate the later singapore isolates were also differentiated from the early isolates by the sequence variant pattern at snv positions 22549 and 23735 in addition the sequence variant sharing pattern at snvs 28008 548 1727 and 13347 can further differentiate the four fifth and six generation isolates into three different sub lineages ( figure 1 ) defined by three distinct variants c t t c in the isolate from patient sin842 t t t c in the isolate from patient sin849 and t c c t in the isolates from patients sin852 and sin848 ( table 1 ) to further confirm this three sub lineage pattern observed in the later singapore isolates we typed another four later singapore isolates from patients sin845 sin846 sin847 and sin850 at five critical snvs ( 19084 28008 548 1727 and 13347 ) the detected sequence variations in the four new isolates supported the three sub lineage pattern in the later singapore isolates ( table 2 figure 1 ) the second and third sub lineages are more closely related to each other than to the first one as all the members of the latter two sub lineages show the variant t at snv position 28008 whereas the two members of the first sub lineage show the variant c the molecular relationship among the viral isolates derived from ms based viral sequence analysis is consistent with the one derived from the whole genome sequence analysis of the same isolates 13 clearly demonstrating that a small subset of commonly shared variances can be used as molecular signature to differentiate and thus track viral isolates we also typed the 18 snvs in four uncultured lung tissue samples from patients sin842 sin848 sin849 and sin852 and compared their sequence variations with their matched cultured isolates ( table 3 ) of the 72 direct sequence variation comparisons ( 18 snvs in four sample pairs ) nine differences were identified six of these were due to heterogeneous sequences in primary tissue samples for example the cultured isolate from patient sin849 showed the sequence variant t t c at snv positions 548 1727 and 13347 a subset of the heterogeneous t / c t / c t / c variant observed in the matched lung tissue sample from the same patient direct comparison of the ms spectrums of the three different sequence variants ( t t / c and c ) at snv position 1727 in figure 2 clearly ruled out the possibility of variant miscall more interestingly the heterogeneous variant t / c t / c t / c in the primary lung tissue sample revealed both of the two existing variants of t t c and c c t seen in other cultured and lung tissue samples ( table 3 ) in addition another three sequence variant differences were observed between the paired cultured and tissue samples from patient sin848 at snv positions14807 26205 and 26509 where the tissue sample showed the sequence variant c c t but the matched culture isolate showed the variant t t c ( table 3 ) in all three snv positions the cultured isolate showed novel sequence variants whereas the primary lung tissue showed the urbani isolates variants ( see table 3 ) the application of tagging and thus tracking of sars cov strains using viral lineage and / or strain specific sequence variants was further demonstrated in our investigation of a clinical sample from a german patient this patient stayed in hanoi vietnam before sharing an airplane flight with an early singapore sars patient on his way to new york via frankfurt 9 german health authorities assumed that this patient was infected somewhere in hanoi vietnam although the possibility of him being infected by a singapore sars cov strain during his flight to new york could not be ruled out we genotyped the virus directly from a brochoalveolar lavage specimen from the german patient at four snv positions ( 19084 23792 26428 and 27111 ) that were distinctive for the early singapore sars cov isolates ( see table 1 ) the sequence of the isolate from the german patient was determined to be t c g a at these snv positions the detection of the variant t at snv position 19084 in the isolate from the german patient strongly suggested that this patient was indeed infected by an early singapore sars cov strain as the t sequence variant at position 19084 was detected only in the early singapore isolates 56 and is clearly different from the c variant at position 19084 observed in the vietnam originated isolates 614 furthermore this german isolates sequence variant t c g a was detected only in the isolate from the singapore primary case sin2748 suggesting that this german patient was probably infected by a sars cov strain originating from or closely related to the sars cov strain of the singapore primary case sin2748 and not from the hanoi outbreak indeed the t c g a variant is also present in the frankfurt 1 isolate 15 which was contracted from the early singaporean patient traveling on the same flight as the german patient through the application of this ms mini sequencing approach to the sars outbreak in singapore we have demonstrated the precision that pathogen sequence data can add to an epidemiological investigation we analyzed 18 sars cov snvs and determined the molecular relationship among the viral isolates from 13 singapore sars patients ( see figure 1 ) from different stages of the singapore outbreak the molecular relationship among the patients viral isolates derived from our ms based viral sequence analysis is not consistent with the current understanding of the clinical transmission relations between these patients according to contact tracing records patient sin2500 was believed to have been the index case of the singapore sars outbreak and to have introduced the sars cov virus into the singapore population following a visit to the hotel m ( hong kong ) 56 patients sin2774 2748 and sin2677 were believed to have been infected directly by the index case sin2500 and patient sin2679 was believed to have been infected by the index case through another unidentified primary patient 5 given the pattern of sequence variations observed in the viral isolates in order for this presumed clinical transmission relationship among these five patients to be correct one has to assume that during viral transmission from index case sin2500 to secondary case sin2679 via an unidentified primary case ( two human to human transmissions ) two reverse mutations at snv positions 19084 and 28268 and one novel mutation at snv position 23174 occurred although this is not impossible it is unlikely considering the observed mutation rate among the post hotel m sars cov isolates 51617 a more parsimonious explanation would be a single mutation scenario in which instead of contracting the virus from the presumed index case sin2500 the secondary patient sin2679 and all the later singapore cases were infected by a virus strain from the hotel m cluster through another as yet unidentified route and during this transmission a novel mutation occurred at snv position 23174 thus patient sin2679 or another unidentified singapore patient from whom patient sin2679 contracted sars should be the index case of all the late generation singapore sars patients further viral genetic characterization of additional singapore sars cases especially early generation ones may shed light on this hypothesis unidentified secondary sars cov infection routes from guangdong to hong kong were also suggested by the genetic characterization of sars cov isolates although none of these contributed substantially to the subsequent hong kong outbreak 618 a further application of ms based viral sequence variation analysis in tracking the virus strain and thus the transmission of sars cov was demonstrated by our confirmation of the singapore origin of a sars cov isolate from a german patient travel and contact tracing records for this german patient indicated more than one potential exposure to sars cov and because virus could not be cultured from the patient it was difficult to pinpoint the origin of his infection by classical sequencing methods that require virus enrichment by culture by genotyping the four snv positions that showed unique variants in the early singapore sars cov isolates we confirmed that this german patient was indeed infected by an early singapore virus strain most likely in a hitherto unnoticed aircraft transmission event from an early singaporean patient who was later hospitalized with sars in germany 9 therefore our results clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the sequence variation information as molecular fingerprint in tagging sars cov viral strains direct viral sequence variation analysis of uncultured lung tissue samples identified cases of heterogeneous viral sequences in single patient samples as the sars cov virus is a single strand rna virus the discovery of different sequences in a single tissue sample suggests the presence of multiple viral sequence variants or quasispsecies within the host when the sample was retrieved our result has further confirmed a recent observation of sars cov quasispecies in individual patients 19 and is consistent with observations in other viral infections furthermore direct comparison between cultured and uncultured samples from the same patient confirmed the existence of the heterogeneous viral sequences only in the uncultured tissue sample which suggests that of the two initial variants in the human host only one survived in the vero cell culture this raises a concern that viral genetic characterization in cultured viral isolates may not capture the whole sequence variation spectrum of a virus in a patient population our study has clearly demonstrated the advantages of ms based genetic analysis as a method for large scale viral genetic characterization in clinical samples firstly ms based analysis has high sensitivity providing successful detection of virus more than 95 of the time at virus concentrations as low as 75 rna copies per reaction ( equivalent to a detection sensitivity of 103 104 rna copies per milliliter ) which is close to the detection limit of real time rt pcr based diagnostic tests ( demonstrated to be 5 85 copies of viral rna per reaction ) 7202122 and within the concentration range reported for sars cov in respiratory and plasma samples 920222324 typical rt pcr sequencing usually requires as many as 1000 copies of template as large pcr fragments are typically amplified with less efficiency than the small fragments ( about 100 bp ) that are commonly used in ms based analysis secondly our detection of heterogeneous viral sequences in single clinical samples demonstrated the accuracy of the ms based assay in characterizing sars cov sequence variations thirdly ms based assay requires only a small amount of starting material for genetic characterization 0 1 l of rna per reaction in the present study currently ms based genotyping analysis of human genetic variation is routinely done in a multiplex fashion where multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms are genotyped simultaneously in a single assay it is thus conceivable that the development of a multiplexing ms based snv assay for sars cov could further reduce the required amount of starting material which would be especially beneficial for analyzing uncultured clinical samples in which viral materials are often limited multiplexing analysis of ms based assays also greatly reduces the cost of analysis to about us $ 0 10 $ 0 20 per analysis ( depending on the level of multiplexing ) which is much cheaper than conventional sequence analysis whose cost is typically a few dollars per analysis therefore ms based sequence variation analysis is a sensitive accurate cost effective and high throughput method for confirming putative variations and characterizing known variations in clinical samples especially for large scale population studies ms based sequence variation analysis is complementary to the identification of new sequence variation by direct sequence analysis and is particularly suitable for investigating agents for which there is already extensive sequence information direct sequence analysis is still the gold standard for identifying new sequence variations but it is inefficient and is not necessary for characterizing known sequence variations in a large number of samples a combination of initial characterization of genome sequence by direct sequence analysis in a subset of samples and the subsequent analysis of informative genetic variations via a ms based approach is more efficient and suitable for large scale population investigations the genome sequences of a wide variety of pathogens and strains are being rapidly accumulated in bacterial pathogens strain sequence information is frequently limited to a relatively small number of genes ( where using all of them simultaneously might be appropriate ) whereas in viruses such as influenza extensive genomic knowledge is accumulating such accumulation of both partial and whole genome sequence information for pathogens will further extend the usefulness of this approach in summary our reassessment of the sars cov transmission route in singapore using ms based viral sequence variation analysis highlighted the limitation of conventional epidemiological analysis based on travel and contact tracing and the importance of informing clinical and epidemiological investigation of pathogen transmission by genetic analysis with its demonstrated high throughput 25 sensitivity accuracy and cost effectiveness in determining viral sequence variations ms based genetic analysis can greatly facilitate the large scale epidemiological investigations of sars cov and other agents of infectious disease and may allow for real time investigation in outbreak situations,

different glycoconjugates in higher invertebrates and vertebrates 1 2 as a part of determinants in many glycoproteins 3 4 sialic acids play an important role in intercellular and / or intermolecular recognition 5 the 9 o acetylation and de o acetylation are the most common modifications of sialic acids found in mammalian cell surface sialoglycoconjugates which can alter its size hydrophobicity net charge and antigenicity 2 6 7 these modifications can regulate a variety of biological phenomena including endogenous lectin recognition tumor antigenicity virus binding and complement activation 8 9 enzymes specifically capable of removing o acetyl esters from the 9 position of sialic acids are sialic acid specific 9 o acetylesterase the enzymes in mammals have two forms one is cytosolic sialic acid specific 9 o acetylesterase ( cse ) in the cytosolic fraction and another is lysosome sialic acid specific 9 o acetylesterase ( lse ) in the lysosomal / endosomal compartment 10 lse is likely to participate in the terminal lysosomal degradation of 9 o acetylated sialoglycoconjugates while cse is likely to salvage any 9 o acetylated molecules that escape the initial action of the lse enzyme the process of de o acetylation of sialic acid which is catalyzed by sialic acid specific 9 o acetylesterase has been implicated in organogenesis and cellular differentiation 2 5 spermatogenesis is a complicated process of germ cell differentiation in adult testis which is established during testicular development there are five types of germ cells each at a specific developmental stage found in the seminiferous tubules spermatogonia primary spermatocytes secondary spermatocytes spermatids and sperms they can be divided into three groups according to their dna content 4n dna content cells ( 4c cells ) 2n dna content cells ( 2c cells ) and 1n dna content cells ( 1c cells ) the separation of these cells enables researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying testicular development and / or spermatogenesis in the present study we separated the 2c and 4c cells of seminiferous tubules in human adult testis by flow cytometry and identified human h lse by differential display rt pcr the expression pattern of h lse was found to be developmentally regulated and stage specific indicating its possible role in testicular development and / or germ cell differentiation human testes were obtained from donation center of nanjing medical university with consent of relatives the seminiferous tubules were collected in dmem / f12 which contained collagenase and washed to remove the leydig cells as well as interstitial cells trypsin treatment and a brief treatment with dnase i were used to release the spermatogenic cells from seminiferous tubules the suspension of cells was filtered with nylon mesh disaggregated spermatogenic cells were suspended at 1 106 cells / ml in 0 5 m sodium citrate solution ( ph 2 35 ) with fresh 0 1 depc overnight at room temperature and at 4 c for two days they were centrifuged and resuspended in 0 5 m sodium citrate solution ( ph 4 5 ) with fresh 0 1 depc for at least 1 day the day before use the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in pbs with 10 mm hepes ( ph 7 0 ) 0 1 bsa and fresh 0 1 depc then the cells were spun down and resuspended in pbs with 100 g / ml pi ( propidium

200 mw wavelength 488 nm ) a 585 nm / 42 nm filter set was used before the fl2 detector cellquest ( becton dickinson ) was used for sorting and the sorting mode was normal r drops per sort were 3 and drop delay was 13 6 the density of cells for sorting was about 1 106 cells / ml isolation of total rna from 2c cells and 4c cells was performed with trizol reagent ( gibco brl ontario ) one hundred nanograms of total rna was used for differential display rt pcr 12 the first chain cdna was synthesized by using t12g t12c and t12a oligo ( dt ) primers and then was used as template in pcr pcr was performed as follows 94 c 1 minute 37 c 1 minute 72 c 2 minutes for 40 cycles ten microlitres of the pcr products from the two cells were run on a 1 5 agarose gel the fragments highly or specifically displayed in 4c cells were excised and purified this dna was reamplified with the same combination of primers and then subcloned into pinpoint xa1 t vector ( promega usa ) the colonies of full length cdna were screened by pcr human testis large insert cdna library ( clontech calif ) was first converted into plasmid cdna library and then an arrayed cdna library in 96 well plates was made according to the method of munroe 13 14 in this arrayed cdna library 1 54 106 colonies were screened by pcr multiple tissue northern ( mtn ) blots ( clontech ) were hybridized with the 32p labeled probes the probe corresponding to 1378 1634 bp of h lse was used for hybridization after stringent wash the blot was placed on the storage phosphor screen ( packard usa ) and exposed for 3 hours in the dark the signal was detected at the cyclone storage phosphor system ( packard ) the stanford tng radiation hybrid panel ( research genetics huntsville ala ) was used to map the chromosomal localization of hse with primers hsemapf ( 5 atgaacaccgtctccacc 3 ) and hsemapr ( 5 aaatctgaaggacccatc 3 ) according to the manufacturers instructions after 35 cycles of amplification the reaction products were separated on a 1 5 agarose gel the positive amplification was labeled as 1 and the negative one was labeled as 0 the results were analyzed through the stanford genome center web server to determine the probable chromosomal location rna dig labeled probes were made by in vitro transcription t7 and sp6 promoter sequences were incorporated into the two sides of the templates ( 195 553 bp of h lse ) by pcr sense and antisense probes were made using dig rna labeling mix ( roche usa ) according to the manufacturers instructions after fixation paraffin embedding mounting and sectioning sections of human embryonic and adult testes were prehybridized in hybridization buffer ( dig easy hyb roche germany ) at 42 c for 2 hours hybridization was carried in hybridization buffer containing appropriate probes at 65 c for 16 hours in humidity chamber subcellular localization of hsei and hseii was performed by the method of green fluorescent protein pegfp c2 hsei and pegfp c2 hseii were constructed using two sets of primers ( hsei 5 ggggaattcaatgatatggtgctgcag 3 and 5 ggggtcgacatttagcaacattgctctg 3 hseii 5 ggggaattcatggtcgcgccggggcttg 3 and 5 ggggtcgacatttagcaacattgctctg 3 ) and ecori / sali restriction sites of pegfp c2 recombinant vectors were transfected into bxpc 3 cells ( bxpc 3 cell is a cell lineage of adenocarcinoma from pancreas ) by lipofectin reagent ( gibco brl ) cells were imaged 40 hours after transfection on the fluorescence microscope after being stained with pi and measured by the fcm three groups of cells in seminiferous tubules of human adult testis were detected ( figure 1 ) 2c and 4c cells were subsequently sorted a clone was identified by differential display rt pcr which was highly expressed in the 4c cells ( figure 2 ) and with high homology ( 86 ) to a mouse lysosome sialic acid 9 o acetylesterase the clone was named h lse in the two rounds of screening in the arrayed cdna library the plasmid containing full length h lse ( genbank accession number af303378 ) was found h lse is 2750 bp in length encoding a putative protein of 523 amino acids with a molecular weight of 58 kd its isoelectric point is 7 19 the n terminus ( 1 18 aa ) of the protein is a region containing hydrophobic amino acid residues which may be a signal peptide by comparison of the protein sequences ( figure 3 ) we hypothesized that h lse is the human counterpart of mouse lysosome sialic acid 9 o acetylesterase after pcr amplification the results can be shown as a pattern ( 000000001000101000000110000010000000110000010000010000010010000000100000000001001001000001 ) retrieving results from the stanford genome center web server shows that hse is localized in the human 11q24 ( figure 4 ) the distribution of h lse in various human tissues was analyzed by northern blot ( figure 5 ) and the results showed the presence of three distinct mrna species at approximately 2 7 kb 6 0 kb and 7 5 kb the expected transcript of h lse was approximately 2 7 kb and it was consistently expressed in all the tissues examined with high expression found in the testis prostate and colon the transcript of approximately 7 5 kb was exclusively expressed in the colon the transcript of approximately 6 0 kb was distributed in the testis colon small intestine prostate and thymus with the highest level of expression found in the testis to examine a possible role of h lse in testicular development and / or spermatogenesis in situ hybridization experiments were conducted to compare h lse expression in human embryonic and adult testes since spermatogenesis is not initiated in the embryo and there is no meiosis in embryonic seminiferous tubules the results showed that no signal was detected in the embryonic testis while positive signals were detected in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia in the seminiferous tubules of adult testis signals were associated with germ cells but not other somatic cells in the testis that is sertoli and leydig cells negative control of sense probes confirmed the specificity of the results ( figure 6 ) the subcellular localization of h lse fusion proteins was visualized by transiently transfecting h lse gene fused with gfp into bxpc 3 cells as shown in figure 7 the control cells transfected with gfp protein alone exhibited fluorescence evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm while gfp h lse fusion protein was compartmentalized in numerous large dense core vesicles in the cytoplasm spermatogenesis is a developmental program that occurs in mitotic meiotic and postmeiotic phases in the mitotic phase spermatogonia proliferate to expand the quantity of germ cells in the meiotic phase spermatocytes accomplish chromosomal synapsis and genetic recombination before two meiotic divisions and in the postmeiotic phase haploid spermatids are remodeled into spermatozoa by the processes of acrosome formation nuclear condensation flagellar development and loss of the majority of cytoplasm under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors spermatogenesis is characterized by the expression of a spectrum of genes that are cell type specific or stage specific they are thought to play an essential role in spermatogenesis at particular stages for example muts homologue 5 is required for chromosome pairing cpeb and scp3 are required for synaptonemal complex assembly and chromosome synapsis in primary spermatocytes 15 16 17 in the present study we have identified a gene h lse from human adult testis with high homology to mouse lse the subcellular localization of gfp h lse fusion protein showed that h lse is concentrated in vesicle like structures in the cytoplasm presumably the lysosomes indicating that h lse is likely to be the lysosome form of sialic acid specific 9 o acetylesterase however our northern blot analysis shows transcripts of different sizes with different tissue distributions they may be the tissue specific transcripts of h lse since others have reported that there are multiple transcripts of mouse sialic acid specific 9 o acetylesterase 2 10 18 the wide distribution of the expected transcript of h lse approximately 2 7 kbp in all tissues examined suggests an essential role of h lse in cellular functions as the most common modification of sialic acids found in mammalian cell surface sialoglycoconjugates 9 o acetylation and de o acetylation play an important role in the transition of antigenicity and transformation of intercellular cross talk 9 o acetylation of sialic acids can mask some epitopes for example natural ligands of the b cell adhesion molecule cd22 beta can be masked by 9 o acetylation of sialic acids 19 similarly it can inhibit binding of sialoadhesin a macrophage restricted and sialic acid dependent adhesion molecule 20 on the other hand 9 o acetylation of sialic acids can form novel epitopes influenza virus c haemagglutinin specifically requires 9 o acetylated sialic acids for binding to host cells 21 incubation of red blood cells with sialate 9 o acetylesterase rendered the erythrocytes resistant against agglutination by influenza c virus 22 o acetylation of disialoganglioside gd3 by human melanoma cells has been reported to create a unique antigenic determinant 23 modifications of sialic acids may be an important mechanism underlying the interaction / cross talk between different types of cells the essential role of sialic acids modification in cellular communications may explain the presently observed wide distribution of h lse in all examined tissues the present study suggests that the expression of h lse is developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage specific the evidence for this includes ( 1 ) lack of expression in embryonic testis ( 2 ) association of high level of mrna detected by dd rt pcr with the 4c but not 2c cells in adult testes and ( 3 ) detection of in situ hybridization signal in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia or other somatic cells in the absence of spermatogenesis embryonic testis contains only two distinct cell types spermatogonia and sertoli cells while the seminiferous epithelium of adult testis consists of germ cells at different stages of spermatogensis the 4c cells found in adult testis include the primary spermatocytes and spermatogonia of g2 / m stage while 2c cells include spermatogonia of g0 / g1 stage secondary spermatocytes and sertoli cells the absence of h lse mrna in embryonic testis and the high level of its mrna in the 4c cells of adult testis suggest that its expression is restricted to spermatocytes particularly the primary spermatocytes together with the in situ hybridization results showing mrna of h lse restricted to spermatocytes but not spermatogonia sertoli cells or interstitial cells these data suggest that h lse is likely to be involved in the process of spermatogenesis although its role in testicular development cannot be entirely ruled out unfortunately due to the deformation of the available human testes we were not able to make further distinction between primary and secondary spermatocytes what has been clearly shown by the present data is that h lse is only present at a stage beyond spermatogonia suggesting its possible role in the differentiation of germ cells interestingly the processes of 9 o acetylation and de o acetylation of sialic acid have been implicated in organogenesis and cellular differentiation since alteration of these processes could lead to interruption of cellular development such as embryogenesis transgenic mice constitutively overexpressed the 9 o acetyl sialic acid specific esterase of influenza c that has been found to arrest embryo development at the two cells stage it has also been reported that in vitro development of embryonic stem cells shows that the expression level of lse is low at the initiation of the development and followed by an increase at later stages 24 in transgenic mice with selective expression of 9 o acetyl sialic acid specific esterase in retina and the adrenal gland these organs showed various abnormalities in organization while all other tissues appeared normal 25 lse has also been considered to play a key role in the differentiation of b lymphocyte 2 since it is expressed in late but not early b lymphocyte the presently observed development dependent pattern of h lse expression is consistent with that found in other cell types absence or low expression at early stage of differentiation but high at later stages taken together 9 o acetyl esters in sialic acids appear to be important for development or cellular differentiation spermatogenesis is a multiple staged continuous progress of cellular differentiation it has been reported that some cell surface glycoconjugates are modified during the early steps of spermatogenesis and influence the differentiation of spermatogenic cells 26 as nine carbon sugars commonly found in many glycoproteins of spermatogenic cells sialic acids represent a target for cell surface modification that is removal of 9 o acetyl esters by enzymes such as lse modification of sialic acids may result in alteration in cell cell communication that is sertoli cells and germ cells interaction thereby influencing the differentiation of spermatogenic cells thus future studies on the presently identified h lse may provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying testicular development and / or germ cell differentiation during spermatogenesis in humans,
04cuk2cn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC552329/,"angelina plyusnina, alexander plyusnin",recombinant tula hantavirus shows reduced fitness but is able to survive in the presence of a parental virus analysis of consecutive passages in a cell culture,,recombination in rna viruses serves two main purposes ( i ) it generates and spreads advantageous genetic combinations and ( ii ) it counters the deleterious effect of mutations that due to the low fidelity of viral rna polymerases and lack of proofreading occur with high frequency 1 the purging function is naturally attributed to the homologous recombination ( hrec ) i e recombination between homologous parental molecules through crossover at homologous sites hrec was first described for the positive sense rna viruses 23 and subsequent studies lead to the widely accepted copy choice model 4 hrec was later shown to occur in rotaviruses thus adding double stranded rna viruses to the list of viruses capable of recombination 5 negative sense rna viruses that occupy the largest domain in the virus kingdom until recently were known to undergo non homologous recombination only forming either defective genomes like polymerase mosaics of influenza a virus di particles 6 and copy backs of parainfluenza virus 7 or hybrids between viral and cellular genes 8 or between different viral genes 9 the first evidence for hrec in a negative sense rna virus has been obtained on hantaviruses 1011 hantaviruses ( genus hantavirus family bunyaviridae ) have a tripartite genome comprising the l segment encoding the rna polymerase the m segment encoding two external glycoproteins and the s segment encoding the nucleocapsid ( n ) protein 12 hantaviruses are maintained in nature in persistently infected rodents each hantavirus type being predominantly associated with a distinct rodent host species 13 when transmitted to humans some hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome whereas other hantaviruses are apathogenic 1415 persistent infection in natural hosts allows for the simultaneous presence of more than one genetically distinct hantavirus variant in the same rodent this may result in hantavirus genome reassortment 1617 or recombination as proposed in the above mentioned study of sibold et al 10 who showed a mosaic like structure of the s rna segment and the n protein of tula hantavirus ( tulv ) most recently we have shown transfection mediated rescue of tulv with recombinant s segment in which nt 1 332 originate from the cell culture isolate moravia / ma5302v / 94 ( or tulv02 for short ) 18 nt 369 1853 originate from the strain tula / ma23 / 87 19 and nt 333 368 that are identical in both variants can be of either origin both m and l segments of the recombinant virus ( rectulv ) originate from tulv02 11 rectulv was functionally competent but less competitive than tulv02 one reason for the observed lower fitness of the rectulv might be that it was generated in the presence of the wt variant with which it has to compete and thus not given enough time to to establish a well balanced mature quasi species population we therefore decided to compare fitness of tulv02 with that of rectulv that underwent several passages in cell culture first we designed rt pcr primers able to discriminate between non recombinant ( v type ) and recombinant ( rec type ) types of tulv s rna the resullts presented in fig 1 show that the primer pairs designed to generate the 118 bp long products from either v type or rec type s rna amplified indeed homologous sequences only whether these were taken along ( lines 1 and 6 ) or mixed with the heterologous sequences ( lines 3 and 7 ) using the two specific rt pcr conditions the presence of v type and rec type s rna was monitored on ten sequential passages of the mixture of tulv02 and rectulv5 variants ( fig 2 ) s rna of v type was seen on all passages ( fig 2a lines 1 10 ) in contrast s rna of rec type was detected up to the fifth passage ( fig 2b lines 1 5 ) and then disappeared ( fig 2b lines 6 10 ) an alternative approach to check the presence of the two different types of s rna using specific primer pairs at the stage of nested pcr gave exactly the same result the v type s rna was detected during all ten passages while the rec type totally disappeared after the 5th passage ( data not shown ) these data confirmed our earlier observation 11 that the transfection mediated hrec yields functionally competent and stable virus rectulv the purified and pre passaged recombinant virus however presented no real match to the original cell adapted variant tul02 it terms of fitness taking into account that the in situ formed recombinant s rna disappeared from the mixture after four passages 11 one should conclude that the lower competitiveness of the recombinant virus seen earlier did not result from its immature status when under similar experimental settings tul02 has been passaging in the presence of another isolate tulv / lodz none of the two viruses was able to establish a dominance during ten consecutive passages ( plyusnin et al unpublished data ) although relatively short the observed survival time of the rectulv in the presence of the original variant tul02 seems to be sufficient for transmission of a recombinant virus in a hypothetical in vivo situation from one rodent to another if transmission is performed in a sampling like fashion and this seems to be the case for hantaviruses 13 the recombinant would have fair chances to survive the existence of wt recombinant strains of tulv 10 supports this way of reasoning evidence for the recombination in the hantavirus evolution continues to accumulate 2021 the genetic swarm of s rna molecules from the rectulv is represented almost exclusively by the variant with a single break point located between nt332 and nt368 the proportion of the dominant variant is larger in the passaged rectulv ( 13 of 14 cdna clones analyzed or 93 ) than in the freshly formed mixture of recs rnas ( 12 of 20 cdna clones or 60 ) 11 thus rectulv already represents a product of a micro evolutionary play in which the best fit variant has been selected from the initial mixture of recs rna whether this resulted from higher frequency of recombination through the hot spot located between nt332 and nt368 or from the swift elimination of all other products of random recombination due to their lower fitness ( the situation reported for polio and coronaviruses 2223 ) or both remains unclear we favor the first explanation as the modeling of the s rna folding suggests formation of a relatively long hairpin like structure within the recombination hot spot ( fig 3 ) secondary structure elements of this kind which might present obstacles for sliding of the viral rna polymerase along the template were suggested as promoters for the template switching in the early studies on polioviruses 22 and considered a crucial prerequisite for recombination 2524 the hairpin in tulv plus sense s rna ( fig 3 ) is formed by the almost perfect inverted repeat that includes nt 344 to 374 in the minus sense rna the structure is slightly weaker due to the fact that two non canonical g u base pairs presented in the plus sense rna occur as non pairing c / a bases in the minus sense rna interestingly in puumala hantavirus a hairpin like structure formed by a highly conserved inverted repeat in the 3 noncoding region of the s segment seems to be involved in recombination events leading however to the deletion of the hairpin forming sequences ( a plyusnin unpublished observations ) the role of rna folding in hantavirus recombination awaits further investigation the data presented in this paper show that the rectulv presents no real match to the original cell adapted variant and that the lower fitness of the recombinant virus can not be increased by pre passaging in cell culture the observed survival time of the rectulv in the presence of the parental virus seems to be sufficient for transmission of newly formed recombinant hantaviruses in nature rectulv ( clone 5 ) was purified from the mixture it formed with the original variant tulv02 using two consequent passages under terminal dilutions 11 after the purification rectulv underwent three more passages performed under standard conditions i e without dilution

mvxz7lx7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC552331/,simon barraclough,australias international health relations in 2003,,australias health relations with other nations in the field of health constitute an important sub set of health policy not only because of the intrinsic significance of bi lateral and multilateral linkages but also because of their ramifications for health policy at the domestic level in broad terms these health relations encompass a range of interactions with consequences for health including membership of global and regional bodies the negotiation of international agreements action to counter particular external threats to health assistance to developing countries and international trade and investment in health related goods and services in 2003 there were continuing developments in all these areas within a wider foreign affairs context overshadowed by official policy concerns about global and regional security the deployment of the australian armed forces in various theatres of service and renewed fears of the human and economic costs of infectious diseases balancing these concerns with national defence were renewed efforts to forge bi lateral trade links in global trade environment characterized by the emergence of trade blocs centred in north america europe and southeast asia although consultation occurs with states and territories it is the australian government that is constitutionally responsible for conducting australias international relations these responsibilities include appointing representatives to international bodies and organizations such as the united nations and its various agencies including the world health organization and assenting to agreements and regulations promulgated by international agencies the formulation and implementation of policy with direct or indirect international health ramifications is not centralized but is usually the result of consultations between various relevant government departments and statutory authorities an important element of the australian governments foreign affairs powers relates to international treaties while a degree of consultation with state and territory governments and with the public occurs and the national parliament is able to scrutinize and comment upon international treaties it is the executive that has the final decision on such agreements in 2003 australia continued to play a strategically important and respected role in international organizations concerned with health especially the world health organization at the world health assembly the governing body of the who the australian delegation supported resolutions concerned with strengthening nursing and midwifery and child and adolescent health in the wake of sars australia also supported the review of the international health regulations and is likely to subscribe to them 1 the voluntary nature of who standards and regulations which can be accepted or rejected by member states is well illustrated by the international health regulations since australia and papua new guinea declined to accept them when they were last promulgated australia should be better placed to influence developments in who in the next three years as a result of being nominated for a term on the executive board the department of health and ageing was closely involved with international comparative health data projects including whos world health survey and the health systems performance survey of the organization for economic cooperation and development australias participation in the health mandate of the commonwealth of nations was illustrated by the therapeutic goods administrations provision of a secretariat for the clearing house of commonwealth agencies for chemical safety australia also participated in the meeting of commonwealth health ministers on the eve of the annual world health assembly of who in geneva 2 in december australia signed the framework convention on tobacco control ( fctc ) the first multilateral treaty negotiated under the auspices of the world health organization for the first time nations were invited to implement control measures covering such issues as health warnings advertising packaging and labelling sales and smuggling they were also called upon to embrace policy measures designed to counter the global tobacco epidemic 3 the fctc provided an impetus to the domestic policies of many countries with limited progress on tobacco control and also allowed for the transnational activities of tobacco corporations to be countered with global policy action the fctc has limited potential to further australian domestic policy which is in advance of that in most countries if necessary the australian government could call upon its external affairs to assert constitutional primacy over this policy area however this is unlikely in the context of close cooperation between various levels of government in australia in establishing national tobacco control policies australian leadership was evident in whos formulation of the fctc having been nominated by the western pacific region as vice chair of the bureau for the negotiating body a reciprocal health care agreement with norway was signed further expanding the rights of australian residents to immediate and necessary treatment in the national health systems of countries with which australia has reciprocal treaties these include new zealand uk italy malta holland sweden finland and the republic of ireland these arrangements are cost neutral and do not include costly accounting or administrative procedures in terms of domestic policy the continuing internationalisation of medicare ( pioneered by the hawke labor party ministry at the time of medicares introduction ) by the liberal national party coalition is paradoxical since local citizens are being encouraged to opt out of public hospital treatment through a rebate on private health insurance and penalties for higher income earners who do not insure privately whilst these agreements have cemented closer diplomatic ties their potential benefits to international travellers especially those subject to punitive insurance premiums or the refusal of insurance due to old age or infirmity remain inadequately publicized treaties are also being negotiated with denmark and belgium following years of negotiations and planning a treaty was signed with new zealand establishing a single joint therapeutic goods agency this body due to commence operations in 2005 will regulate prescription and retail drugs therapeutic devices and also complementary medicines it will replace the australian therapeutic goods administration and its new zealand counterpart to a large extent the two regulatory systems will have been integrated although there are still areas of disagreement ( e g policies on the advertising of pbs medicines ) which will need to be negotiated this joint agency creates a model in international health relations which other states could profitably emulate where they share common concerns and have similar health systems in december 2002 the two countries finalized treaty arrangements establishing both a joint standards code and a joint statutory authority food standards australia new zealand 4 these arrangements parallel bi lateral developments for the joint regulation of food standards these developments have furthered australian foreign policy concerned with establishing trans tasman free trade commenced some two decades ago with the negotiation of the closer economic relations agreement with new zealand the new regulatory arrangements have created a virtual trans tasman free market in food ( subject to plant and animal quarantine considerations ) and therapeutic drugs while not having the legal status of a treaty for some years the department of health and ageing has had memoranda of understanding with its counterparts in china indonesia thailand and japan in 2003 further activities were undertaken under the auspices of these agreements during the state visit of chinas president hu jinta a plan of action was signed between the two health ministries the indonesian relationship continued with the inclusion of a health delegation to the sixth australia indonesia ministerial forum in jakarta in march preceded by two rounds of meetings between officials of the indonesian and australian health departments the australia japan partnership in health and family services formed the basis for negotiations for joint research on mental health and an international conference on suicide prevention 5 in a related development the department of foreign affairs and trade promoted aged care expertise as an export service through the australia japan conference in the course of 2003 australia finalized free trade agreements ( in reality preferential trade agreements ) with singapore and thailand and continued negotiations with the usa 6 from the perspective of the australian health industry the agreement with singapore offered tariff free trade in pharmaceuticals and other therapeutic goods and the gradual removal of tariffs in the case of thailand all countries imposed reservations on free trade in the sensitive areas of health services although traditional thai massage exponents will be permitted to operate in australia domestically these agreements required intersectoral policy collaboration in the interests of health policy makers in the department of health needed to intensify their understanding of the dynamics of international trade while those making foreign policy had to consider the health dimensions of ostensibly commercial arrangements the free trade agreement with the usa raised controversies about attempts to include the pharmaceutical benefits scheme ( pbs ) in concessions demanded by us negotiators these issues have been outlined in the account of developments in the pbs elsewhere in this series of review articles the emergence and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) to several countries in east and southeast asia and to canada revived popular atavistic fears of pandemics and damaged the tourism and travel industry as well as some australian suppliers of goods and services to asia who issued a global alert on the disease in march and the last reported case of international occurred in july so serious was the threat of sars to the economies of some countries that a special meeting of health ministers attended by australia was organized by asia pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) to discuss the situation a task force was subsequently established by apec to deal with sars an example of the economic costs of the disease was the decision by the governments of singapore and australia to postpone negotiations on a greater share of the sydney los angeles air route ( dominated by qantas ) for the singapore carrier due to uncertainty about demand in australia sars was declared a quarantinable disease under the quarantine act 1908 and policy guidelines for health professionals airline and border control staff and the general public were developed by the department of health and ageing which also led an inter departmental task force to monitor world developments until july 2003 when the who announced that no country was still considered sars affected international aircraft arriving at australian airports were required to obtain sars free clearance nurses were posted at airports and restrictions on elective surgery were placed on travellers returning from affected countries 7 during the period of whos alert australia had reported only five probable and one laboratory confirmed case of sars australias official international development assistance programme is an important foreign policy tool especially in the asia pacific region some $ 225 m ( of a total of $ 1 8 b ) was allocated to health related international development assistance in 2003 4 budget of the australian agency for international development ( ausaid ) however while australias contribution to hiv / aids control and its regional advisory role associated with sars were acknowledged by the foreign affairs minister in his report to parliament health assistance received little prominence security good governance and counter terrorism were emphasized as the focus for the official foreign aid programme support for essential services in papua new guinea continued as a major imperative 8 the lower priority of health was further underscored by a decision to no longer appoint designated health advisors to the permanent staff of ausaid it should be noted however that the emergence of sars served to reinforce health as an important element on the international assistance agenda the fact that the domestic health workforce is now part of a global market for skilled workers was further demonstrated by continuing efforts to recruit nurses from overseas the decision of the australian health ministers conference to sanction dentists from selected commonwealth countries to work in public clinics in addition a scheme to recruit overseas trained medical practitioners was included in the australian governments medicare plus policy initiatives 9 it is intended that these doctors will work in rural and remote areas officially designated as having medical workforce shortages and also in positions within aboriginal controlled community health services yet metropolitan hospitals are have also become reliant upon overseas trained doctors for their staffing this policy accompanied by the liberalization of immigration arrangements for medical doctors has represented a volte face from previous policies deliberately designed to discourage foreign doctors from immigrating in the belief that controlling the number of doctors would contribute to cost containments of medicare it also continues to raise the ethical danger of australia contributing to a brain drain of medical staff from countries that are themselves short of such expertise in 2002 the commonwealth of nations had agreed to a code of practice for the international recruitment of health workers to help safeguard the interests of developing nations australia has endorsed the code the australian government will need to handle policies associated with the recruitment of overseas trained health personnel with care due to professional sensitivities and the need for legislation at the state level to regularize the status of some professions this brief review of australias international health relations in 2003 has demonstrated that health must be seen as an integral part of trade and security within the wider foreign policy context the protection of health in free trade arrangements is important for their domestic legitimacy it is vital that those involved in health policy are aware of its potential international dimensions while those responsible for foreign affairs include health in their approach official health linkages have served to promote good will in some otherwise difficult relationships as has been the case with indonesia they have also helped to promote a positive international image for australia the opinions expressed in this article are the sole responsibility of

m9rg6d3w,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC554982/,"bruno sainz, heather lamarca, robert garry, cindy morris",synergistic inhibition of human cytomegalovirus replication by interferon alpha / beta and interferon gamma,,human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) is a ubiquitous beta herpesvirus that affects 60 80 of the human population 1 the lytic replication cycle of hcmv is a temporally regulated cascade of events that is initiated when the virus binds to host cell receptors upon entry into the cell the viral dna translocates to the nucleus where expression of viral immediate early ( ie ) early and late genes occurs in a stepwise fashion 2 while generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals primary hcmv infection may cause infectious mononucleosis and has been associated with atherosclerosis and coronary restenosis 34 furthermore hcmv is the leading contributor of congenital viral infections in the united states and europe causing cytomegalic inclusion disease pneumonia and severe neurological anomalies in infected neonates 5 7 like other herpesviruses hcmv establishes lifelong latency in its host from which reactivation can occur and cause severe and fatal disease in immunocompromised individuals 8 cellular immune responses ( mhc class i restricted t cells and natural killer ( nk ) cells ) appear to be an important factor in both the control of acute infections and the establishment and maintenance of viral latency in the host 9 14 however the mechanisms by which t cells affect hcmv replication are currently undefined while cytotoxic t cell activity has been shown to correlate with recovery from hcmv infection in patients 1516 recent studies suggest that immune cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interferons ( ifns ) may have direct inhibitory effects on hcmv replication 1718 in particular the involvement of ifns as a means of curtailing viral replication without cellular elimination is consistent with the hypothesis that cytokines produced by activated immune cells play a direct role in the control of viral infections 19 21 type i ifns ( ifn and ifn ) and type ii ifn ( ifn ) are important components of the host immune response to viral infections ifn and ifn are produced by most cells as a direct response to viral infection 22 24 while ifn is synthesized almost exclusively by activated nk cells and activated t cells in response to virus infected cells 25 both types of ifns achieve their antiviral effects by binding to their respective receptors ( ifn / or ifn receptors ) resulting in the activation of distinct but related janus kinase / signal transducer and activator of transcription ( jak / stat ) pathways the result is the transcriptional activation of ifn target genes and the synthesis of a number of proteins that interfere with viral replication ( reviewed in 26 ) although ifns are effective inhibitors of viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus 26 almost all rna and dna viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert the host ifn response 212627 for example hcmv inhibits ifn stimulated antiviral and immunoregulatory responses at multiple steps 2428 32 likewise the herpes simplex virus ( hsv 1 ) protein icp34 5 33 the influenza a virus ns1 protein 34 the simian virus 5 v protein 35 the sendai virus c protein 36 the hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) ns5a and e2 proteins 37 and the ebola virus vp35 protein 38 have all been shown to block ifn mediated responses in infected cells however several studies have shown that viruses normally resistant to the effects of type i or type ii ifns separately are susceptible to ifns when used in combination for example ifn / and ifn synergistically inhibit the replication of hsv 1 both in vitro and in vivo 20 in addition recent reports have indicated that ifns used in combination have a synergistic antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus ( sars cov ) 39 hcv 40 and lassa virus 41 in the present study we examined the effects of ifn ifn and / or ifn on hcmv replication in human foreskin fibroblasts ( hffs ) treatment of hffs with ifn ifn or ifn separately inhibited hcmv replication by 40 fold in both plaque reduction and viral growth assays in contrast treatment with ifn and ifn or ifn and ifn inhibited hcmv replication 10 20 times greater than that achieved by each ifn separately this effect was synergistic in nature and the mechanism of inhibition may involve at least in part the regulation of ie gene expression as with hsv 1 20 we have found that when used in combination both type i and type ii ifns potently inhibit the replication of hcmv in vitro the abilities of human ifn ifn or ifn to inhibit the replication of hcmv were initially compared in a plaque reduction assay on hffs viral plaque formation was reduced by 9 37 or 29 fold in fibroblasts treated with 100 iu / ml of ifn ifn or ifn respectively ( table 1 ) to test the effects of combination ifn treatments on viral plaque formation hffs were pre treated with 100 iu / ml each of ( 1 ) ifn and ifn ( 2 ) ifn and ifn or ( 3 ) ifn and ifn as expected the level of inhibition achieved with both ifn and ifn was not greater than the level of inhibition achieved by both ifns separately in contrast pre treatment with both type i ifns ( ifn or ifn ) and type ii ifn ( ifn ) reduced hcmv plaquing efficiency by 164 and 662 fold respectively ( table 1 ) to eliminate the possibility that this effect was merely a result of doubling the total amount of ifns per culture we tested the inhibitory effects of 200 iu / ml of each ifn separately two hundred iu / ml of ifn ifn or ifn reduced hcmv plaque formation by only 11 37 or 30 fold respectively ( table 1 ) the level of inhibition was not significantly greater than the level of inhibition achieved by each ifn at concentrations of 100 iu / ml ( p > 0 05 ) suggesting that the degree of inhibition observed can be attributed to the presence of two distinct types of ifns figure 1 shows a representative micrograph of hcmv plaque formation on ifn treated hffs consistent with the results in table 1 hcmv plaque efficiency was reduced and plaque morphology was smaller in cultures treated with a combination of type i and type ii ifns ( figure 1e f ) this phenotype was also observed in cultures treated with ifn alone ( figure 1d ) although the overall inhibitory effect of ifn was similar to that achieved in ifn treated hffs the antiviral activity of ifns on hcmv plaque formation was further assessed by generating dose response curves ( figure 2a ) the level of inhibition achieved with individual ifn treatments was 8 fold for ifn or ifn and 18 fold for ifn at all concentrations tested in contrast combination ifn treatments achieved levels of inhibition 2 18 times greater than the sum of each individual ifn treatment to determine if the enhanced inhibition of hcmv observed in hffs treated with both type i and type ii ifns was synergistic we employed the synergistic analysis for the determination of the interaction of two drugs 4243 interaction indexes were initially calculated from the data generated in the dose response experiments ( figure 2a ) to assess the synergistic potential of type i and type ii ifn treatment an interaction index of 0 05 0 03 for ifn and ifn combined and 0 04 0 01 for ifn and ifn combined indicated a high degree of synergy ( table 2 ) additionally synergy was confirmed by generating isobolograms in which concave isoboles are indicative of synergy while convex isoboles are indicative of an antagonistic effect ( figure 2b ) inhibitory concentrations were determined from dose response experiments and ic95 isoboles were generated for hffs treated with both ifn and ifn ( figure 2c concave plot ) and hffs treated with both ifn and ifn ( figure 2d concave plot ) consistent with the interaction indexes determined ( table 2 ) concave isoboles shown in figures 1c and 1d indicate a synergistic relationship between type i ifns ( ifn and ifn ) and type ii ifn ( ifn ) suggesting action via distinct antiviral pathways to further characterize the inhibitory effect of type i ifns ( ifn or ifn ) and type ii ifn ( ifn ) treatment four day viral growth assays were performed in cultures treated with ifn ifn or ifn viral replication was undetectable or below the lower limit of detection at 1 and 2 days ( d ) post infection ( p i ) at 3 d p i however hcmv replicated to average titers of 8350 1050 or 985 pfu / ml in ifn ifn or ifn treated cultures respectively ( figure 3 ) while vehicle treated cells replicated to average titers of 3 2 104 pfu / ml viral titers recovered from cells treated with ifns separately were reduced by 6 23 or 25 fold respectively moreover at 4 d p i viral titers in cells treated with ifns separately were equal to viral titers recovered from vehicle treated cultures consistent with our plaque reduction assays we observed a similar enhanced inhibitory effect when hffs were treated with a combination of type i and type ii ifns in cultures treated with 100 iu / ml each of ifn and ifn or ifn and ifn hcmv replication was detectable beginning at 3 d p i yielding titers at or below the lower limit of detection of the assay compared to hcmv titers of 1 105 pfu / ml at 4 d p i in vehicle treated hffs treatment with ifn and ifn or ifn and ifn inhibited hcmv replication in hffs by an average of 3125 or 5000 fold respectively when compared to ganciclovir ( gcv ) treated cells a known dna synthesis inhibitor of hcmv the level of inhibition achieved in gcv treated cultures was comparable to that in ifn and ifn or ifn and ifn treated cultures at 3 and 4 d p i ( figure 3 ) in addition the potent inhibitory effect observed in the presence of ifn and ifn was maintained up to 11 d p i ( figure 3 inset ) indicating that the effect was not merely a delay in viral replication the hcmv replication cycle is a multistep process beginning with viral attachment and entry into the host target cell 2 to investigate the mechanism ( s ) by which ifn / and ifn synergistically inhibit hcmv replication we first examined the effect of ifns on hcmv entry into hffs cells were treated with vehicle or ifns for 12 hours ( h ) prior to infection with hcmv two h after viral adsorption dna was isolated from the hcmv infected cells and pcr was used to amplify a 373 bp fragment of the hcmv ie gene ( figure 4 ) for each treatment group the pcr product yield increased as a function of viral multiplicity of infection ( moi ) at all mois tested the amount of pcr product amplified from hffs treated with ifns ( figure 4b f ) was comparable to that of vehicle treated hffs ( figure 4a ) co amplification of a gapdh 239 bp pcr product served as an internal loading control for normalization of pcr product between treatment groups ( data not shown ) the amplification of similar levels of pcr products from hffs suggests that the synergistic inhibitory effect of ifn / and ifn does not occur at the level of viral entry hcmv gene expression is temporally regulated in that the ie genes ( ie1 and ie2 ) are the first class of viral genes expressed after hcmv entry into the cell 44 although limited studies have examined the effect of ifn or ifn treatment on hcmv ie mrna expression the conclusions of these studies are conflicting most likely due to differences in both ifn and cell type 4546 to assess the effect of ifn treatment on ie gene expression real time pcr analyses of ie1 and ie2 mrna levels in ifn treated cells were performed figure 5 summarizes the fold repression in ie1 and ie2 mrna levels in ifn treated cultures as compared to vehicle treated controls at 6 h p i ie mrna levels in hffs treated individually with either ifn or ifn were inhibited by < 2 fold whereas in cells treated with both ifn and ifn ie1 or ie2 mrna expression was inhibited by 6 or 5 fold respectively a more enhanced inhibitory effect was observed in hffs treated with both ifn and ifn in these cultures ie1 or ie2 mrna expression was repressed by 11 or 8 fold respectively interestingly the degree of ie mrna inhibition observed in hffs treated with ifn alone was greater than that observed in cultures treated with ifn alone suggesting that type i ifn mediated inhibition of ie mrna expression is better facilitated by treatment with ifn rather than ifn ie protein expression plays a pivotal role in controlling subsequent viral and cellular gene expression during productive hcmv infection 47 such that an inhibitory effect at this level would significantly impair viral replication to determine whether the inhibitory block in ie mrna expression correlated with decreased ie protein expression in ifn treated cultures western blot analyses were performed ( figure 6a ) at 12 h p i a slight reduction in ie72 and ie86 protein expression was observed in hffs treated with ifn but not with ifn or ifn moreover ie72 and ie86 protein expression was decreased in cells treated with both type i and type ii ifns with the greatest inhibitory effect observed in hffs treated with both ifn and ifn this inhibitory block in ie protein expression was consistent throughout a 48 h time period ( data not shown ) if ifn / and ifn synergistically inhibit hcmv replication through inhibition of ie gene expression we hypothesized that this inhibitory effect would be maintained after multiple rounds of viral replication to address this question ie protein expression was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence over a 5 day period for all treatment groups ie protein expression was detected as early as 1 h p i however as viral replication progressed ie protein expression among ifn treated groups varied ( data not shown ) notably by day 5 p i nearly 100 of the cells treated with vehicle ifn or ifn alone stained positive for ie72 / 86 and approximately 87 of the cells treated with ifn alone were expressing the ie proteins ( figure 6b 6e ) in contrast the percentage of cells expressing ie proteins was significantly reduced ( p < 0 001 ) in the treatment groups that received combination ifns with only 46 of ifn and ifn treated hffs and 21 of ifn and ifn treated hffs positive for ie72 / 86 ( figure 6f 6g ) the observed differences suggest that in cells treated with both type i and type ii ifns ie expression is ( 1 ) differentially regulated and / or ( 2 ) viral spread is severely hindered the immune response to viral infection is responsible for preventing viral dissemination and uncontrolled replication within the host following viral infection type i ifns are secreted by infected cells and function to induce an antiviral state in neighboring uninfected cells infiltrating immune cells such as nk cells and macrophages secrete numerous chemokines and cytokines that contribute to the overall antiviral response upon activation of the adaptive immune response t cells can further add to the milieu of immune cytokines present at the site of viral infection by secreting additional cytokines including ifn although several studies have examined the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on hcmv replication in vitro these studies are limited as they only examine the effect of one type of cytokine on viral replication rather than examining cytokines in combination in support of the latter recent studies have shown that type i and type ii ifns function in synergy to inhibit both rna and dna viruses including hcv 41 sars cov 39 lassa virus 40 and hsv 1 20 these studies may more accurately represent the in vivo inflammatory response that results after viral infection the results presented herein are consistent with this hypothesis and establish that type i ( ifn and ifn ) and type ii ( ifn ) ifns synergistically inhibit the replication of hcmv in the present study we have demonstrated that combination treatment with type i and type ii ifns renders cells non permissive to hcmv replication in vitro the inhibitory effect by ifn / and ifn was synergistic in nature ( table 2 figure 2c 2d ) and the degree of inhibition was not matched by increasing the concentrations of each individual ifn ( table 1 figure 2a ) these results indicate that the observed ifn induced antiviral effects are a direct result of the presence of two distinct types of ifns moreover inhibition of hcmv replication in cells treated with ifn / and ifn was observed in both hff and embryonic lung fibroblasts ( mrc5 ) ( data not shown ) infected with either towne gfp ( see methods ) or another laboratory strain ad169 ( data not shown ) the mechanism ( s ) by which hcmv replication is inhibited remains unclear type i and type ii ifns may synergize by acting on one or more different stages of the hcmv lytic cycle such as ( 1 ) viral attachment ( 2 ) viral entry ( 3 ) ie gene expression ( 4 ) early gene expression ( 5 ) dna replication ( 6 ) late gene expression ( 7 ) virus assembly or ( 8 ) viral egress and maturation to address the question of attachment and entry pcr was used to amplify viral dna from ifn treated and vehicle treated cultures shortly after infection as previously observed 2046 ifn treatment did not prevent viral entry into cells as indicated by equal pcr product yield from all treatment groups ( figure 4 ) these data indicate that ifns exert their inhibitory effects at a step after viral attachment and entry previously yamamoto et al ( 1987 ) demonstrated that treatment of cells with both ifn and ifn potently inhibits hcmv replication however this study neither determined whether the effect was synergistic nor identified the mechanism of inhibition however the authors suggested that ifn mediated inhibition of hcmv might occur at or prior to early gene expression 48 similarly over the course of our experiments utilizing the towne gfp strain it was noticed that very few cells expressed green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) when treated with ifn / and ifn together ( data not shown ) in this recombinant towne strain gfp expression is driven by the early promoter ul127 the lack of gfp positive cells in ifn / and ifn treated groups suggested to us that the synergistic antiviral activities mediated by type i and type ii ifns occurred at a stage prior to early gene expression previous studies have shown that type i or type ii ifn treatment can inhibit hcmv ie mrna expression 46 and / or hcmv ie protein expression 4546 using real time pcr we showed that while ifn ifn or ifn treatment inhibited ie mrna expression by 2 6 fold at 6 h p i combination ifn and ifn or ifn and ifn treatment inhibited ie mrna expression by 6 11 fold of note this inhibitory effect was abolished by 24 h p i ( data not shown ) suggesting that ie mrna expression is delayed by ifn treatment the observed decrease in viral ie mrna expression was accompanied by a decrease in ie protein expression as viral ie protein expression was reduced in hffs treated with both type i and type ii ifns ( figure 6a ) furthermore immunofluorescent microscopy of ie protein expression revealed that nearly 100 of vehicle and individual ifn treated cells expressed ie72 / 86 5 d p i as compared to 46 or 21 of cells treated with ifn and ifn or ifn and ifn respectively ( figure 6b 6g ) it appears that although individual ifn treatment results in a marginal inhibition in ie expression early in infection the effect is not maintained as demonstrated by high viral titers at 4 d p i ( figure 3 ) and increased ie protein expression at 5 d p i ( figure 6a 6e ) additionally hcmv cytopathic effect characterized by enlarged cells containing intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions increased over time in vehicle and individual ifn treated groups while morphology was unchanged in cells treated with ifn / and ifn ( data not shown ) collectively these data suggest that the synergistic inhibition of hcmv replication by ifn / and ifn may involve at least in part the regulation of ie gene expression the significance of an inhibitory block at this level is evident when the phenotype of ie1 mutant viruses is considered greaves and colleagues have demonstrated that hcmv ie1 mutants exhibit a diminished replication efficiency and a reduced ability to form plaques as well as defective early gene expression 474950 interestingly in the presence of both type i and type ii ifns hcmv shows similar replication and gene expression defects although our data suggest that ie gene regulation contributes to the synergistic inhibition of hcmv replication by ifn / and ifn other mechanisms may also affect this dramatic response accordingly the decrease in ie protein levels exceeds that in ie mrna levels in response to ifn / and ifn suggesting that additional regulation at the level of translation post translational processing and / or protein stability may be involved delineating the other putative regulatory mechanisms that contribute to ifn / and ifn synergistic inhibition of hcmv replication is the focus of ongoing studies type i ifns ( ifn and ifn ) and type ii ifn ( ifn ) activate distinct but related jak / stat signal cascades resulting in the transcription of several hundred ifn stimulated genes 26 although similar genes are activated by all three ifns der et al ( 1998 ) have identified numerous genes differentially regulated by ifn ifn or ifn 51 in particular ifn stimulation induces twice as many genes as compared to ifn this differential regulation of ifn induced genes may explain in part the fact that the level of inhibition observed in hffs treated with both ifn and ifn was consistently greater than that observed in cells treated with both ifn and ifn although both ifn and ifn bind to the same receptor similarly when compared individually ifn consistently inhibited hcmv replication and ie gene expression to levels greater than ifn therefore to better understand the cellular factors involved in the synergistic inhibition of hcmv the profile of ifn stimulated genes present in cells treated with both type i and type ii ifns should be further examined guidotti and chisari have reported a model of noncytolytic control of viral infections by the innate and adaptive immune response in which cytokines are implicated as having a direct role in viral clearance 21 here we demonstrate that ifn together with the innate ifns ( ifn / ) synergistically inhibits the replication of hcmv in vitro we hypothesize that ifn produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type i ifns to inhibit hcmv dissemination and facilitate the establishment and / or maintenance of latency in the host further studies are required to evaluate the role ( s ) of both type i and type ii ifns in the regulation of hcmv replication hffs ( viromed minneapolis mn ) were maintained in minimal essential medium ( mem ) supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum penicillin g ( 100 u / ml ) streptomycin ( 100 mg / ml ) 2 mm l glutamine 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 100 m non essential amino acids at 37 c in 5 co2 hcmv strain rvdlmwt gfp was propagated in hffs as previously described 52 rvdlmwt gfp referred to as towne gfp throughout this manuscript is a recombinant of hcmv strain towne that expresses gfp under the control of the early promoter ul127 this virus was kindly donated by mark f stinski and has been previously described 53 recombinant human universal ifn ifn and ifn ( pbl biomedical laboratories new brunswick nj ) were added to cell cultures 12 h prior to hcmv infection and maintained after viral infection concentrations of 100 iu / ml of each ifn were used in all experiments unless stated otherwise for plaque reduction assays vehicle and ifn treated hffs were infected with a fixed inoculum of towne gfp after 2 h adsorption the inoculum was removed and medium containing 1 0 methylcellulose ( fisher scientific houston tx ) and the respective ifn ( s ) was added to the cells plaque numbers were determined 14 d later by fluorescent microscopy ( nikon te300 inverted epifluorescent microscope nikon usa lewisville tx ) for viral replication assays vehicle and ifn treated hffs were infected with towne gfp at a moi of 2 5 after 2 h adsorption the inoculum was removed monolayers were washed twice with 1x pbs and fresh ifn containing medium was returned to each well for gcv treated groups 100 m gcv ( sigma st louis mo ) was added to culture medium immediately following infection one 2 3 or 4 d p i cells and medium were harvested and titers of infectious virus were determined by a microtiter plaque assay on hffs 20 to determine the degree of antiviral interaction between type i and type ii ifns interaction indexes were calculated using the inequalities da / da + db / db > 1 and da / da + db / db < 1 where da and db are the ifn concentrations needed to jointly produce the effect under consideration and da and db are the ifn concentrations capable of producing the effect on their own termed isoeffective doses 42 interaction index values of less than 1 indicate synergism interaction index values greater than 1 indicate antagonism and interaction index values equal to 1 indicate additivity isobolograms were also generated to geometrically assess the degree of antiviral interaction between type i and type ii ifns as previously described 43 using the guidelines described by berenbaum 43 isoboles were generated for ic95 values at various concentrations of ifn or ifn in the presence of various concentrations of ifn concave isoboles are indicative of synergy while convex isoboles are indicative of an antagonistic effect ( figure 2b ) for all synergy experiments hcmv plaque reduction assays were conducted as described above vehicle and ifn treated hffs were inoculated with towne gfp at mois of 0 3 1 3 10 or 30 after 2 h adsorption the inoculi were removed cells were washed twice with 1x pbs and

pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis,,although pain is the presenting symptom of most patients with chronic pancreatitis its neurobiological basis remains poorly understood 1 in the past investigators have focused on the role of anatomical abnormalities such as a strictured pancreatic duct or narrowed intraparenchymal ducts however mechanical decompression techniques such as endoscopic stent placement or even surgical pancreatojejunostomy frequently do not provide a permanent solution to the pain 1 more recently investigators have begun focusing on the role of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins such as substance p and nerve growth factor with known or suspected roles in nociceptive signaling and / or sensitization and have reported an increased expression of several of them in the pancreas of patients with painful chronic pancreatitis 2 mast cells are also increased in both acute and chronic pancreatitis 34 but their role in the generation of pain in pancreatitis has not been investigated we hypothesized that mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis this hypothesis is based on the following observations first mast cells have been associated with human conditions in which pain is a predominant symptom interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome are both conditions in which pain is out of proportion to the objective pathological findings 56 in both conditions an increase in the number of mast cells has been described in the bladder and the colon respectively 56 further mast cells are frequently found in close proximity to nerves in the intestinal mucosa and the bladder 7 9 this has also been observed in the pancreas the total number of mast cells was significantly higher in pancreatic tissue from patients with chronic pancreatitis than in the normal pancreatic controls 3 one of the preferential locations of mast cells was around and within the perineurium of nerve fibers in tissue samples of patients with chronic pancreatitis suggesting the potential for interactions between mast cells and the nervous system lastly there is evidence for bi directional functional communication between mast cells and nerves 10 12 mast cells can not only release mediators that increase excitability of neurons but in turn neurotransmitters such as substance p can trigger mast cell degranulation 10 mast cells may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of pain in pancreatitis through degranulation products that can sensitize pancreatic afferent neurons in an ongoing vicious circle of neuronally mediated mast cell degranulation our first aim was to analyze the presence and distribution of mast cells in autopsy specimens of chronic pancreatitis and study the correlation if any with historical documentation of pain we then explored our hypothesis further using an experimental model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( tnbs ) induced chronic pancreatitis in both wild type and kitw / kitw v mice a strain deficient in mast cells ( mcdm ) autopsy records from the university of texas medical branch from the years 1993 to 2000 were searched electronically for the term pancreatitis one hundred sixty six patients were identified of which 26 patients carried an autopsy diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and 140 patients carried a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis the medical charts from patients with an autopsy diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis were reviewed for documentation of a medical history of chronic pancreatitis if no such documentation was present in the chart patients were excluded from the study ( 12 / 26 ) thus 14 / 26 patients with both a documented history and an autopsy based diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis were included in the study patients were categorized as painful chronic pancreatitis ( 8 / 26 ) when they fulfilled one of the following criteria a documented history of chronic abdominal pain clinically attributed to chronic pancreatitis that required the use of narcotics and / or frequent admissions for recurrent abdominal pain clinically attributed to chronic pancreatitis and / or a surgical or endoscopic procedure for refractory abdominal pain clinically attributed to chronic pancreatitis patients were categorized as non painful chronic pancreatitis ( 6 / 26 ) if patients did not fit any of the criteria listed under painful chronic pancreatitis in addition the following data were collected demographic factors ( age and race ) cause of death comorbidities clinical history of pancreatitis etiology of pancreatitis diagnostic studies supporting a diagnosis of pancreatitis ( amylase lipase calcifications on abdominal plain film ct scan ultrasound or ercp ) human pancreatic control tissue was obtained from 8 arbitrarily chosen patients of whom the autopsy records recorded acute myocardial infarction as the cause of death their medical records were reviewed to ensure that they did not have a clinical history of pancreatitis therefore there were three categories of patients one with painful chronic pancreatitis one with non painful chronic pancreatitis and non pancreatitis controls a pathologist blinded to the group assignment verified all histological diagnoses and counted mast cells on a giemsa stained tissue section ( average of 10 high power randomly chosen ( 40x ) fields per specimen ) the protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the university of texas medical branch all mice were purchased from the jackson laboratory ( bar harbor me ) male mice were used from the following strain wbb6f1 / j kitw / kitw v ( mcdm ) and the respective littermate control mouse strain kitw v + / + ( wt ) the mice were 3 months of age at the onset of the experiment with body weights of 25 30 gram experimental protocols involving mice were approved by our institutional animal care and use committee ( iacuc ) in accordance with the guidelines provided by the national institutes of health mice were anesthetized with sodium nembutal ( 50 mg / kg body weigh i p ) following a midabdominal laparotomy a canula was introduced into the common pancreato biliary duct the duct was ligated proximally and distally to ensure perfusion into the pancreas and prevent entry of the injected substance into the liver or duodenum 0 1 ml of 1 tnbs in phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) 10 ethanol ph 8 was infused into the pancreas ( modified after puig divi 13 ) the canula was removed and the abdomen closed control mice were treated in the exact same fashion but were perfused with saline instead ( figure 1 ) mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after surgery vff hairs consist of a series of filaments of increasing diameter that produce increasing sensations of touch when applied to the skin when the tip of a fiber of given length and diameter is pressed against the skin the force of application increases until the fiber bends after the fiber bends continued advance creates more bend but not more force of application this principle makes it possible to apply a reproducible force to the skin surface vff testing is an established behavioral pain assay used to determine mechanical pain thresholds in somatic pain more recently vff testing has been used as a surrogate marker for visceral pain 1415 mice were placed in a cage with a mesh floor and habituated to the environment for 30 60 minutes measurements were taken from the abdomen and the plantar surface of both hindpaws over a period of three weeks prior to the surgery and for a total of three weeks after the surgery ( figure 1 ) vff filaments of various caliber were applied to the mid abdomen in ascending order 10 times each for 1 2 seconds with a 10 second interval a response was defined as a ) sharp retraction of the abdomen b ) immediate licking or scratching of site of application of hair or c ) jumping the response frequency was defined as the total number of responses out of 10 applications ( expressed as a percentage ) to the skin per filament an investigator blinded to the different treatment groups performed the behavioral testing fresh specimens of the mouse pancreas were fixed in 10 formaldehyde in pbs ph 7 4 containing 1 mm mgcl2 at 4 c overnight sections from paraffin embedded specimens were stained with hematoxyline and eosin and observed under a light microscope pathological changes were scored based on a scale described by tito et al by a pathologist blinded to the different treatment groups 16 comparisons of the number of mast cells in autopsy specimen were analyzed using the mann whitney u test for each behavioral experiment ( see figure 1 ) the average response frequency was calculated as the mean of the mean response frequencies for each mouse ( across four measures ) the post pre response frequency was calculated by subtracting the pre surgical average response frequency from the post surgical average response frequency to assess the independent effect of tnbs on vff response ( ie to control for the effect of the surgery itself ) the post pre response frequency for tnbs infusion was compared with the post pre response frequency for saline infusion this comparison was performed using analysis of variance for a two factor experiment with repeated measures on time at each level of force for each type of mice ( wt and mcdm ) the two factors were induction of pancreatitis or not ( tnbs or saline respectively ) and time ( pre surgical or post surgical ) tnbs infusion was considered to have had an independent effect on the vff response if the post pre response frequency was greater for tnbs than for saline infusion fishers least significant difference procedure was used for multiple comparisons of least squares means with bonferroni adjustment for number of comparisons all effects and interactions were assessed at the 0 05 level of significance data analysis was conducted using proc mixed with lsmeans options in sas release 8 2 sas institute inc sas / stat users guide version 8 cary nc sas institute inc 1999 patient demographics are summarized in table 1 alcohol abuse was the most common cause for pancreatitis in both groups analysis of our results using the mann whitney u test revealed significantly more mast cells in patients with a history of painful chronic pancreatitis ( n = 8 ) when compared to patients with either non painful chronic pancreatitis ( n = 6 ) ( 33 8 vs 9 4 average mast cell count / 10 high power fields p < 0 01 ) or controls ( n = 8 ) ( 33 8 vs 6 1 average mast cell count / 10 high power fields p < 0 01 ) ( figure 2 ) the increased number of mast cells in patients with painful pancreatitis was noted predominantly in interstitial areas and to a lesser degree in the periacinar space figure 3 shows the post pre surgical response frequency for both wt and mcdm tnbs had a significant independent effect on abdominal vff response in wt mice at the force levels 4 and 8 mn ( p = 0 007 and 0 037 respectively ) ( figure 3a ) there was a trend towards a significant effect at the force level of 16 mn ( p = 0 066 ) in contrast for mcdm tnbs had no significant effect on abdominal vff response at any force level ( figure 3b ) there was no significant tnbs effect on vff response in the left hindpaw for either wt mice or mcdm ( figure 4 ) data not shown for the right hindpaw pancreatic histology confirmed the presence of chronic pancreatitis in both wt and mcdm with marked fibrosis inflammatory infiltrates and ductular proliferation mimicking changes seen in human chronic pancreatitis ( figure 5a ) the pancreas of saline treated controls was normal there was no significant difference in the overall inflammatory scores between the wt and mcdm ( figure 5b ) an increased number of mast cells were counted in wt mice with chronic pancreatitis compared to saline treated controls ( 5 6 vs 1 5 p = 0 05 ) ( figure 6 ) as to be expected no mast cells were present in pancreas of mcdm chronic pancreatitis has been defined as a continuing inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by irreversible morphologic changes that typically cause pain and / or permanent loss of function 17 the pathogenesis of pain in this condition remains to be satisfactorily established we examined the association if any of pain with mast cells as quantified in autopsy specimens of patients with a history of painful and non painful chronic pancreatitis and normal controls significantly more mast cells were present in pancreatic tissue from patients with a history of painful chronic pancreatitis indicating an association with this condition and a potential role for these cells in the pathogenesis of pain in painful chronic pancreatitis there are clearly limitations to a retrospective autopsy based study such as the one we report here for instance we do not know whether pain was present at the time of death and there was incomplete information on the different patterns of pain also our findings pertain mainly to patients with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis nevertheless our findings do suggest an association of painful chronic pancreatitis with an increased number of mast cells this observation provided the rationale for further experimental testing which we performed in mice we first developed a model of chronic pancreatitis in mice following a modified protocol first described by puig divi et al 13 histological changes consisted of periductal and lobular fibrosis duct stenosis chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates and gland atrophy mimicking features of chronic pancreatitis in humans significantly more mast cells were present in wt mice with chronic pancreatitis adding to the validity of this model for use in studies on the role of mast cells in pancreatitis both wt and mcdm developed histological changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis indicating that the elimination of mast cells did not modulate the animals ability to mount an inflammatory response therefore any changes observed in pain behavior are unlikely to stem from differences in underlying inflammation next we determined whether this mouse model could be used to study behavioral differences associated with chronic pancreatitis the assessment of spontaneous pain in a visceral organ presents significant difficulties we have used a behavioral method to assess this which relies on the association of visceral pain with sensitization of somatic regions of the body that share segmental innervation at the level of the spinal cord ( referred pain ) this somatic sensitization can be quantified using vff to stimulate the somatotopically appropriate abdominal region and measuring the abdominal withdrawal response thus vff testing of the anterior abdominal wall can be used as a surrogate marker for visceral pain although this is the first time that this technique has been used for the measurement of referred visceral hyperalgesia in a mouse model of chronic pancreatitis this method has previously been described and validated to assess the severity of referred visceral pain for models of colonic hypersensitivity 14 as well as rat models of acute necrotizing pancreatitis 15 and chronic pancreatitis 18 the abdominal vff response was compared to the hind paw response to assess the specificity of the interventions to the pancreas tnbs treated mice but not the saline control developed increased abdominal wall withdrawal responses to vff testing when compared to baseline suggesting the development of force dependent referred hyperalgesia of the abdominal wall in wt mice there was no evidence of referred hyperalgesia in the hindpaws suggesting that the measured effect on abdominal withdrawal is specific for an intra abdominal origin of the pain vera portocarrero et al previously described similar findings increased withdrawal frequency after vff stimulation to the abdominal area in a rat model of chronic pancreatitis 18 these behavioral changes were abrogated by morphine rats that demonstrated behavioral changes also expressed increased substance p expression in the nociceptive layers of the spinal cord suggestive of central nociceptive changes mast cells produce a variety of degranulation products in the setting of inflammation that may activate and / or sensitize primary nociceptive neurons the neurotrophin growth factor ( ngf ) is one such product 19 22 ngf is released in the setting of inflammation and can not only function as a chemoattractant for other mast cells but it can also trigger mast cell degranulation 23 we are speculating that ngf production in the inflamed pancreas is responsible for plastic changes in the sensory neurons by activating proalgesic receptors and channels such as the ngf receptor tyrosine kinase a ( trka ) and transient receptor potential family v receptor 1 ( trpv1 previously known as vr1 ) thereby contributing to the generation of pain 24 26 similarly other mast cell degranulation products such as tryptase and histamine are capable of modulating neuronal function 27 32 tryptase may directly activate the proteinase activated receptor 2 ( par 2 ) a g protein coupled receptor expressed by pancreatic nerves important in the pathogenesis of pain in pancreatitis 3334 although the role for mast cells in the mediation of visceral nociceptive signaling needs to be explored further we speculate that mast cell products released in pancreatitis contribute to the development of pain by direct effects on nociceptors located on pancreatic afferent neurons ( figure 7 ) however before concluding a definite role for mast cells from our experimental data it should be noted that mcdm carry a spontaneous mutation for tyrosine kinase receptor c kit which not only produces a deficiency of mast cells but may have an independent effect on the function of sensory neurons which are known to express it 35 therefore it remains to be determined whether the detected differences in nociceptive responses is due to the absence of mast cells per se or a yet unknown change in the responsiveness of sensory neurons due to a congenital lack of the c kit receptor reconstitution of mast cells into the mcdm mice should restore their nociceptive responses close to the wild type phenotype our data should increase awareness of the importance of mast cells in the pathogenesis of painful

89xnnvuv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC555555/,ali saad,orientation determination by wavelets matching for 3d reconstruction of very noisy electron microscopic virus images,,three dimensional ( 3d ) reconstruction of virus particles like sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) and hsv ( herpes simplex virus ) using electron microscopy yields crucial information for understanding the assembly and infectivity mechanism the structural determination begins with acquisition of projection images in an electron microscope a major part of data processing is aimed at determining the direction of projection for each particle image ( 2d projection of virus ) so that a 3d reconstruction can be computed the first step in a virus reconstruction is the detection and selection of the individual particle images from a large area of an electron micrograph there are different criteria to determine the particle orientation one criterion is based on the computational search of the common lines in the computed fourier transforms of individual or multiple particle images 1 an improvement of the fourier common line algorithm 2 has been proposed but a significant amount of the low contrast particle images are still discarded partly because of the impossibility of obtaining a reliable estimate of their orientations another criterion for the particle orientation estimate is to find the correlation match between the raw images with many projections from a 3d model 3 regardless of the criterion used finding the orientation determination for a particle image such as that in fig 1a is difficult because of its extremely low contrast one approach is to take two consecutive pictures of the same particles one close to focus ( fig 1 a ) and another farther from focus with a higher contrast ( fig 1 c ) from which the initial orientations are easily determined 45 the initial orientations are then assigned to the corresponding particles in the close to focus images for structural refinement ( henceforth called focal pair method ) in a high resolution structure determination one would require over 6000 particles of data for 8 5 a resolutions 6 if a focal pair is required one would need over 12000 particles and hence it is a labor intensive process of data recording digitization and archiving in this paper we propose a method for determining the initial orientations of the particles from low contrast ( close to focus ) images without necessity for a second set of highly defocused images in this technique we use the wavelet transformation in a multi resolution analysis 78 to enhance the contrast of the image and the hierarchical weighted projection matching to accelerate the processing the wavelet transformed images have the same size as the original images wavelet decomposition separates the low resolution information called approximation from the high resolution information called details this method computationally generates an image equivalent to the far from focus picture taken by the microscope and separates images containing details and noise the technique proposed here is a model based approach in wavelet space which we call hierarchical wavelet projection matching ( hwpm ) a data set of 600 hsv 1 capsid particle images in different orientations was used to test the hwpm method the defocus range of herpes particles was chosen to be close to focus between 1 7 m and 0 4 m an initial model of about a 40 a resolution 4 was used to generate projections uniformly covering the asymmetric triangle of the icosahedrally symmetric hsv 1 capsid particle 45 a grid sampling of 0 5 in each direction of the asymmetric triangle of icosahedral particles was used the number of projections obtained with this grid was relatively high ( 2616 projections ) first the 2616 projections were grouped into 200 classes each class containing about 13 projections a match of the particle into the best 3 of the 200 classes was obtained using the wavelet correlation coefficient ( wccf ) criterion next the particle was compared to the 39 projections of the best three classes and the correct orientation was that of the projection giving the highest wccf the hierarchical implementation wavelet projection matching reduced the time at least by a factor of 10 compared with the classical projection matching method in the example of 600 particles by using hwpm it took approximately 3 hours to determine the orientations instead the 33 hours it took with the classical matching algorithm both algorithms were running on the sgi origin 2000 supercomputer using 10 processors at this point each particle had been assigned the orientation of the closest projection a quality factor was assigned to each orientation which was the wavelet correlation coefficient particles having high wccf coefficients were selected for reconstruction of a first 3d model of the virus refinement of initial orientations obtained by hwpm was realized by the same iterative refinement process used in focal pair method 5 this refinement process uses both local and global refinement local refinement refines orientations against a set of projections from the 3d density map in global refinement all the raw particle orientations are refined against each other without using projections from the 3d model a potential merit of global refinement is the absence of possible bias arising from the 3d model in order to assess the accuracy of the orientations obtained with the hwpm a comparison with the focal pair method ( fig 5 a ) which is currently the most appropriate method for low contrast virus images was accomplished the following steps were executed first the initial orientations of the far from focus particles were determined by using the cross common line method between real particles and a set of projections obtained from the low resolution model next a global refinement process was realized in order to determine the initial orientation the same software as in 4 was used with the same initial parameters the parameters used in this software were the minimum radius and maximum radius limiting the resolution and the sampling step size of 4 67a / pixel the minimum valid radius ensured that the minimal radius was computationally accurate when the two common lines angles were close and also to avoid the biasing of the orientations of particles by the very low frequency components this parameter choice for herpes at the above sampling step was 5 pixels the maximum radius was chosen to limit the maximum resolution expected from the reconstruction here in the initial orientation the maximum radius corresponding to a resolution about 40 a then an assignment of the particle orientations from the far to focus to the close to focus is realized next an iterative refinement process to the close to focus data was accomplished as described in 5 a 3d reconstruction using the best 300 hsv 1 particle orientations was performed for each method fig 5 a and fig 5 b show surfaces density contour displayed at one standard deviation above the mean density 9 obtained respectively from focal pair method and hwpm method both structures show a similar visual resemblance in order to assess the reliability of the 3d density maps and the quality of particles orientations obtained from each method the fourier shell correlation ( fsc ) criterion which is the most robust criterion 1011 was employed the fsc was calculated between 2 independent reconstructions from the same set of orientations for each method the effective resolution assessment of the 3d structure obtained from each method is estimated at fsc correlation value of 0 5 which correspond to 45 phase difference fig 6 shows three different plots the green curve shows a resolution of 32 a of the reconstruction using the best 300 particles with orientations obtained from the focal pair method the blue curve shows a resolution of 24 a of the reconstruction using 300 particles with orientations obtained from the hwpm method this result shows that the resolution of the structure obtained from the hwpm is higher than the one using the orientations from the focal pair method therefore the orientations obtained from hwpm method are more accurate furthermore hwpm method uses only one set of close to focus data instead of the two sets used by the focal pair method the purple curve shows a resolution of about 14 5 a of the reconstruction using 500 particles with orientations assigned by hwpm the red curve plots twice the expected fsc for gaussian noise a less stringent criterion to assess the resolution as the intersection between the fsc curve and the curve plotting the 2 times expected gaussian noise hwpm was tested on a p22 empty shell capsid which was circular and whose shell is very thin ( 40 angstrom ) twenty micrographs of the p22 empty shell capsid with defocus range 0 5 to 2 m were used for testing purpose the total number of particles is 1340 each image has a size of 300 300 pixels and the dimension of each pixel is 2 8 a concerning the initial orientations determinations using hwpm method an initial model of around 20 a resolutions was used to generate projections which uniformly covered the asymmetric triangle of the icosahedrally symmetric model a grid sampling of 2 in each direction of the asymmetric triangle of icosahedral symmetry was used to obtain an initial orientation targeting a structure of 30 a the number of projections obtained with this grid was about 200 projections a match of the particle with the projections was obtained by using the wccf criterion the correct orientation was selected as the one of the projection giving the highest wccf the better half of the orientations projections ( 650 ) according to wccf criterion was chosen for final reconstruction the initial orientations for the same set of data were determined using the improved common line ( icl ) method with the same input parameters for the software described in 2 icl use one single micrograph and does not use focal pair technique the best half of the particles orientations ( 650 ) was chosen according to the phase residual criterion in the 3d reconstruction of the p22 fig 7 shows three surface views of the p22 empty shell capsid the top image shows the original surface 1213 the lower right image shows the surface obtained by hwpm which shows a very similar view to the original structure the resolution assessment of the structure by fourier shell correlation criterion gives a resolution of 14 5 a the lower left surface shows the result obtained by icl method the surface view of the reconstruction obtained from the icl of the p22 empty shell capsid is different from the original p22 capsid fig 7 proves the inaccuracy of some of the initial orientations obtained from the icl method for such a smooth virus during the last thirty years the common lines methods were a great method to resolve icoshedral particles up to 7 8 a 6 recently a method using polar transformation and projection matching were used for the purpose of orientation determination 3 but this last method is not suitable for the high resolution of large virus because the resulting transformed images could be double the size of the original image the proposed method combines the projection matching of wavelet denoising for an initial determination of particle orientation with the common lines method for refinement to a higher resolution it is clear that hwpm method works only if the initial low resolution model of the particle is already known this method is very interesting if we need to add more particles to an existing intermediate resolution reconstruction in order to increase the resolution particles having high resolution information are very noisy 914 the best that we can get using the icl method is less than 40 of good orientations for defocus values between 1 9 m and 1 2 m for the p22 capsid 2 usually very high resolutions use defocus values which go much lower than 1 2 m as in the hsv data or the current p22 data which goes to 0 5 m the 40 rate of correct orientations would certainly become smaller if we used data at closer defocus the study accomplished on high resolution for hsv reconstruction showed that using a close to focus single micrograph with cl method was not effective because a small number of orientations were found to be correct 9 for this reason a focal pair method was used for 8 5 a structure 9 at high resolution reconstructions the number of particles needed increases drastically and the data with a signal to noise ratio valid up to the targeted resolution tend to be very noisy for an 8 5 a structure of hsv 1 it took about 6000 particles for a final reconstruction for a 6 5 a structure resolution the estimated value was about 50000 particles using the same electron microscope 14 to further increase the resolution of the hsv virus to 6 5 a or higher ( 4 a ) the focal pair method would be impracticable the focal pair method for intermediate resolution up to ( 8 a ) for big viruses like hsv works well for orientations determinations the number of particles selected for the final reconstruction about 40 of the original number of particles ( taking into account the far focus and close focus micrographs ) it is necessary to emphasize that results from both methods are very similar in terms of visual resemblance but there are two advantages of hwpm over the focal pair method first focal pair method uses as much as double the data used for the hwpm second the quality of the density maps shows that hwpm gives a better resolution for the same number of particles ( figure 6 ) this proves a better accuracy of orientations determinations obtained by the hwpm one of the more obvious advantages of the hwpm for orientation accuracy appears in two examples of real reconstructions the first is for the p22 capsid the icl method does not give a good initial orientation and the refinement of the orientations does not help to converge toward the right orientations the probable reasons why the icl method did not work properly for the p22 capsid are first the p22 capsid has a smooth surface ( the thickness of the shell is about 40 a ) second most of the data are very close to focus with defocus range of 0 5 m to 1 3 m the data was noisy and had a very low contrast the icl method was able to give 40 of good orientations for the defocus range between 1 9 and 1 2 m here the data was closer to focus which reduced the percentage of good orientations to less then 22 the application of the hwpm to the p22 empty shell capsid gave the expected structure ( fig 7 ) the wavelet denoising in the hwpm not only helped in reducing the noise and enhancing the contrast of the particles but also used the entire information from the image ( instead of using several lines ) which is enhanced accuracy for highly noisy particles another example of real data reconstruction is the vp5 vp19c recombinant after long investigation using cl and icl algorithms the classical projection matching scheme was also tested in order to determine the orientations but unfortunately all those methods failed the wavelet filtering and matching was used during the classification step of the recombinant particle vp5 vp19c 1516 which significantly improved the quality of the class averages 16 18 and enabled the determination of the structure of that particle a study 16 shows the superiority of the wavelet projection matching over the gaussian filtered projection matching the third examples for low ph sindbis three years of investigation using cl and icl methods failed to obtain the correct density map of the low ph sindbis capsid which is subject to conformational changes and an alteration of the symmetry recently the proposed method ( hwpm ) was tested on low ph sindbis and the correct structure was finally observed and analyzed 19 wavelet multi resolution analysis and processing improves particle detections 8 classification 1516 and orientation determination on a variety of electron microscopy images which are highly noisy and have an extremely low contrast this prove that wavelet techniques are adequate in the 3 main steps of 3d virus reconstruction and in the classification step of single particle reconstruction 1617 this paper describes the development and implementation of a new method for orientation determination for low contrast images of virus particles this method is based on wavelet filtering which enhances the contrast of the particles and reduces the noise and on weighted projection matching in wavelet space a hierarchical implementation of this method increases the speed of orientation determination results show that hwpm have been able to determine accurately more than 85 of the orientations of low contrast particles compared to the focal pair method ( for orientation determination from low contrast data ) the hwpm reduced the amount of data required in a reconstruction by at least 50 in addition the accuracy of the orientations obtained by the proposed method is higher than those obtained by focal pair method 9 this improved accuracy is shown clearly by the resolution assessment in fig 6 the estimated number of particles needed for a 6 5 a reconstruction of the hsv 1 capsid was about 50000 14 by using the hwpm method only half as much data was necessary the proposed method could save 2 to 3 man years invested in acquiring images from the microscope and data processing another advantage of this method is the ability to give accurate orientations for some particles having conformational changes or alteration of symmetry as seen for vp5 vp19c recombinant and recently with the low ph sindbis capsid the choice of wavelet filter bases depends on the signal signals coming from different sources have different characteristics for audio speech image and video signals the best choices of wavelet bases are known the best choice for electron microscopic images is not clear the problem is to represent typical signals with a small number of convenient computable functions an investigation to choose the best wavelet bases for electron microscopic images was performed here during this study simulated and real electron microscopy images were used the majority of the wavelets basis existing in matlab 5 software 20 24 was tested the criterion used to determine the best wavelet base was the one which optimizes the signal to noise ratio in a broad spectrum of spatial frequencies the bi orthogonal wavelets basis 25 27 especially the 3 5 basis in matlab 5 yielded the best average signal to noise ratio in the range of the spatial frequency ( 1 / 100 1 / 8 a 1 ) relevant to data analysis the principle of the wavelet decomposition is to transform the original raw particle image into several components one low resolution component called approximation 21 which is mainly used in this method and the other components called details ( fig 2 ) the approximation component is obtained after applying a bi orthogonal low pass wavelet filter in each direction ( horizontal and vertical ) followed by a sub sampling of each image by a factor of 2 for each dimension the details are obtained with the application of a low pass filter in one direction and a high pass filter in the other or a high pass filter in both directions the noise is mainly present in the detail components a higher level of decomposition is obtained by repeating the same filtering operations on the approximation the wavelet correlation coefficient between two wavelet transformed images for a given level is  where w1 to wp are weights given for each components of the wavelet correlation p is the number of components of wavelet decomposition a1 a2 are the approximations denote the correlation between two components images d1i d2i are the details ( fig 2 ) this implementation starts first by a wavelet filtering which is performed by thresholding 212829 of the details components in order to reduce the noise effects in the correlation matching higher weight is given to the approximation component to further reduce the noise effect in the decision the weights given in this implementation are 0 75 for the approximation and 0 25 for the details initial orientation determination is based on model based projection matching approach 3 the level of wavelet decomposition depends on the dimension of the virus and the sampling rate for herpes simplex virus type 1 ( hsv 1 ) b capsid which has a diameter of 1250 a with a sampling of 2 1 a / pixel a level two of wavelet decomposition ( fig 2 ) is appropriate for the initial orientation estimate because of the contrast enhancement and the consideration of computational speed the method starts by generating the wavelet decomposition at level two for each projection and raw image in order to have accurate orientation estimation a small angular grid ( figure 3 ) to generate projections from the initial model is needed and this results in a large number of projections the classical projection matching which consists of comparing the wavelet transformed raw images with every projection is very slow even when using multiple processors on a parallel computer in order to significantly increase the speed of processing a hierarchical implementation is performed this consists of grouping projections into classes of similar orientations 30 fig 3 shows the classification scheme applied for the icosahedral viruses only an asymmetric triangle representing the possible orientations for icosahedrally symmetric object 4 is considered the choice of the number of classes is optimized to give the best tradeoff between speed and accuracy the classification gives a uniform distribution of projections into the classes the next step is to compare each wavelet transformed raw image with the closest projection to the center of each class and then rank the classes in terms of wccf ( fig 4 ) the final step is to compare the raw image with all the projections of the three classes given the highest wccf coefficients next the orientation of the projection yielding the highest wccf will be assigned to the raw image as the correct orientation the software is written in c + + ( a parallel version of the software has been written to run on the sgi origin 2000 supercomputer ),

abundant recombination in a virus during a single multi cellular host infection,,as increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently 123 recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range 4567 or increasing their virulence 89 thus accompanying or perhaps even being at the origin of major changes during virus adaptation it remains unclear however whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented 10 intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates ( in rna viruses ) 11 or homologous or non homologous recombination ( in both rna and dna viruses ) quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches in vitro ( in cell cultures ) 12131415 and in vivo ( in live hosts ) 161718 the in vitro approach which has so far been applied only to animal viruses allows the establishment of the intrinsic recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures 141519 however it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire living hosts where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells the in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in the real world however as discussed below numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination first many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection where only recombinant genomes were viable ( e g 132021 ) other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by pcr within infected hosts or tissues 1822232425 which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population so far no quantitative pcr or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host finally recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate rather than the individual recombination rate 12627 while results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account there are other caveats isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale taken together the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses this study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus ( camv ) during a single passage in one of its host plants ( the turnip brassica rapa ) camv is a pararetrovirus which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses ( e g hepatitis b virus ) badnaviruses ( e g banana streak virus ) and caulimoviruses ( e g camv ) pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded dna genome after entering the host cell nucleus the viral dna accumulates as a minichromosome 28 whose transcription is ensured by the host rna polymerase ii 29 the camv genome consists in approximately 8000 bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta ( figure 1 ) 30 viral proteins p1 to p6 are expressed from two major transcripts namely a 19s rna encoding p6 and a 35s rna corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mrna for proteins p1 p5 31 using the pre genomic 35s rna as a matrix the protein p5 ( product of gene v ) reverse transcribes the genome into genomic dna that is concomitantly encapsidated 30 the detection of camv recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation ( i ) of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones 2132333435 or ( ii ) of a transgenic plant containing one camv transgene with a camv genome missing the corresponding genomic region 36 while the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination the latter demonstrated that camv can also recombine with transgenes within the hosts genome another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various camv strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and hence multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus 37 indirect experimental evidence has indicated that in some cases camv recombination could occur within the host nucleus between different viral minichromosomes presumably through the action of the dna repair cellular machinery 2135 nevertheless the mechanism of template switching during reverse transcription predominant in all retroviruses most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses for this reason and on the basis of numerous experimental data camv is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell by legal template switching between two pre genomic rna molecules 2135363839 or illegal template switching between the 19s and the 35s rna 3640 under this hypothesis recombination in camv could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription with the 5 and 3 extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic dna ( position 0 in figure 1 ) the above cited studies clearly demonstrate that camv is able to recombine however since these studies are based on complementation techniques non quantitative detection or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an everyday process shaping the genetic composition of camv populations in the present work we aimed at answering this question to this end we have constructed a camv genome with four genetic markers demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments by co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing camv particles we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified altogether the recombinant genomes averaged over 50 of the population further analysis of these data assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to 20 indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of camv is of the same order of magnitude i e on the order of a few 10 5 across the entire genome we thereby provide the first quantification to our knowledge of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host from figure 1 and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes + bcd / a + + + a + cd / + b + + ab + d / + + c + abc + / + + + d + + cd / ab + + a + + d / + bc + and a + c + / + b + d indeed all classes were detected and their frequencies in the ten camv populations analyzed are summarized in table 1 altogether the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed ( table 1 last column ) ranging between 44 ( plant 5 ) to 60 ( plants 7 12 and 20 ) with a mean frequency ( standard error ) of 53 8 2 0 this result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by camv and represents to our knowledge the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host the inferred per generation recombination and interference rates assuming that camv undergoes ten replication cycles during the 21 d between infection and sampling are given for each of the ten plants in table 2 recombination rates between adjacent markers are large on the order of 0 05 to 0 1 taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of 4 10 5 interestingly this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome ( kruskal wallis test p = 0 16 ) to relax the assumption of the number of replications during the 21 d we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or 20 generations the effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate ( detailed results not shown ) for example the average recombination rates r 1 r 2 and r 3 assuming 20 generations were equal to 0 05 0 04 and 0 025 respectively ( compare with values in table 2 ) yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of 1 9 10 5 2 2 10 5 and 1 6 10 5 inspection of table 2 also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance the mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section one major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed indeed the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness on phylogenetically based analyses or on experiments in cell cultures for reasons detailed in the introduction the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination but only its occurrence or address the question at a different temporal and often spatial scale results from cell cultures on the other hand impose cell co infection by different viral variants potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural more than half of the genomes ( 53 8 2 0 see table 1 ) present in a camv population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of 2 10 5 to 4 10 5 the time length of one generation i e the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next is totally unknown in plant viruses the only experimental data available on camv are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts where the capsid protein is produced between 48 and 72 h 40 the reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic dna being two coupled phenomena 30 we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of 2 d and thus an average of ten generations during our experiments in case this estimate is mistaken we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the camv generation time is more precisely established at this point we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments it was previously shown that about 95 of camv mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies 41 where they may be sequestered for a long time as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks the viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate in order to minimize this bias the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf where the chances of finding genomes from unsequestered lines were assumed to be higher in any case our data analysis is conservative since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci we believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts indeed one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype in the former analogous to clonal propagation recombination is undetectable in the latter recombination is not only detectable but as our results indicate very frequent samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events thus yielding an impression of negative interference these conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models it is indeed easy to show ( detailed results not shown ) that if a proportion f of the population reproduces clonally analogous to single infections while the remaining reproduces panmictically negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist for example assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r 1 and r 2 and interference i 12 the apparent recombination and interference parameters would be r 1 = ( 1 f ) r1 r 2 = ( 1 f ) r 2 and i 12 = ( f i 12 ) / ( 1 f ) interestingly this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative that a fraction f of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate as judged by r 1 r 2 and r 3 calculated between markers a b b c and c d respectively we found evidence for recombination through the entire camv genome the values for r 1 r 2 and r 3 are remarkably similar hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome we considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in camv as already mentioned in the introduction hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the 5 extremities of the 35s and 19s rnas 213642 if other recombination mechanisms such as that associated with second strand dna synthesis or with the host cell dna repair machinery act significantly hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption 1 2 and 3 43 due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the 5 end of the 35s rna and to 1 ( at nucleotide position 0 ) nevertheless the putative hot spots at the 5 end of the 19s rna and at 2 and 3 ( nucleotide positions 4220 and 1635 respectively ) fall between marker pairs c d b c and a b respectively our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or more likely that they simply do not exist whatever the explanation what we observe is that the camv can exchange any portion of its genome and thus any gene thereof with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection to our knowledge the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus 3 in contrast retroviruses and particularly hiv 1 have been extensively investigated in that sense as we have already discussed for these latter cases the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures the estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in hiv 1 is on the order of 10 4 141519 less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for camv because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host camv recombination rate we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in camv is higher and perhaps on the order of that of hiv other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells including steps of nuclear minichromosome genomic size rna synthesis and reverse transcription and encapsidation nevertheless vertebrate hepadnaviruses ( e g hepatitis b virus ) infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations thus even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses shared biological characteristics they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution we used the plasmid pca37 which is the complete genome of the camv isolate cabb s cloned into the pbr322 plasmid at the unique sali restriction site 44 to analyze recombination in different regions of the genome we introduced four genetic markers a b c and d at the positions 881 3539 5365 and 6943 respectively thus approximately at four cardinal points of the camv circular double stranded dna of 8024 bp ( figure 1 ) all markers each corresponding to a single nucleotide change were introduced by pcr directed mutagenesis in pca37 and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites bsiwi psti mlui and saci in a plasmid designated pmark s because in this study we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes all markers a b c and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames i iv v and vi respectively another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection i e to create neutral markers consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations ( see below ) to generate the parental virus particles plasmids pca37 and pmark s were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described 33 all plants were turnips ( b rapa cv just right ) grown under glasshouse conditions at 23 c with a 16 / 8 ( light / dark ) photoperiod thirty days post inoculation all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier 45 the resulting preparations of parental viruses designated cabb s and mark s were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by hull et al 46 we fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of 0 5 and a solution containing 0 1 mg / ml of virus particles of both cabb s and mark s at a 1 1 ratio was prepared plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with 20 l of this virus solution using abrasive celite afa ( fluka ronkonkoma new york united states ) the mixed camv population was allowed to grow during 21 d of systemic infection we designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed cabb s / mark s virus population after a single passage in a host plant twenty four individual plants inoculated as above with equal amounts of cabb s and mark s were harvested 21 d post inoculation when symptoms were fully developed the viral dna was purified from 200 mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously 47 after the precipitation step of this protocol the viral dna was resuspended and further purified with the wizard dna clean up kit ( promega fitchburg wisconsin united states ) in te 1x ( 100 mm tris hcl and 10 mm edta ph 8 ) aliquots of viral dna preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a b c or d and submitted to a 1 agarose gel electrophoresis colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to uv each individual restriction enzyme cut once in cabb s dna and twice in mark s thus generating dna fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of camv genomes after scanning the agarose gels we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral dna preparation and at each marker position by densitometry using the nih 1 62 image program the statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below to identify and quantify the recombinants within the camv mixed populations aliquots from ten of the 24 viral dna preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme sali and directly cloned into puc19 at the corresponding site in each of the ten viral populations analyzed 50 full genome length clones were digested separately by bsiwi psti mlui and saci to test for the presence of marker a b c and d respectively in this experiment with the marker representing an additional restriction site we could easily distinguish between the cabb s and the mark s genotype at all four marker positions upon agarose gel ( 1 ) electrophoresis of the digested clones clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes whereas clones harboring 1 2 or 3 markers were clearly recombinants due to the very high number of recombinants detected markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the camv genome because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral we first discuss assumption we used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers both resulting from plants co infected with a 1 1 ratio of mark s and cabb s the first consisted of viral dna densitometry data derived from 24 plants ( described above ) where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population the second consisted of the restriction of 50 individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant ( described above ) yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker and this was repeated on ten different plants the frequencies of the different markers were 0 508 0 501 0 516 and 0 507 for markers a b c and d in the first dataset and 0 521 0 518 0 514 and 0 524 in the second dataset we tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality 0 5 using either t tests for datasets where normality could not be rejected ( seven out of eight cases ) or wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise ( marker c in the first dataset ) in all cases p values were larger than 0 05 there are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses first in all cases we found an excess of markers unfortunately the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first we thus have only four independent estimates in each case and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size it should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the 1 1 ratio in the infecting mixed solution or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants second because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations the results clearly show however precisely that the markers do not have large effects if any and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers because of this along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the camv genome we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis the dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the 500 full genome length viral clones ( 50 from each of ten co infected plants ) individually genotyped for each of the four markers as discussed in detail in the results recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers indeed approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype it was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host consequently we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the 21 d that infection lasted in our experiment ( we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral dna from each infection ) based on the kinetics of gene expression 40 we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between 2 and 3 d and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time in case this assumption is incorrect we did calculations assuming five seven ten or 20 replication cycles during these 21 d as shown the results were not affected qualitatively and only slightly quantitatively it is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism and that therefore from a recombination point of view the camv genome is linear the reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position 0 in figure 1 which is the point of circularization of the dna genome this implies that changes between contiguous markers a b b c and c d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot as they may simply stem from circularization of dna during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a b b c or c d to estimate the recombination rate between markers we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation assuming random mating and no selection ( i e the standard wright fisher population genetics model ) we then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies ( we assumed that the two parental genotypes mark s and cabb s had equal initial frequencies of 0 5 and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero ) and frequencies after n generations ( the observed frequencies as stated above we used different values of n ) all algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software mathematica the recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci e g r 1 for the recombination rate between markers a and b and the interference coefficients e g i 12 for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c to define these parameters we followed christiansen 48 and in particular the recombination distributions for two three and four loci ( respectively tables 2 7 2 8 and 2 9 of 48 ) it is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered in other words we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus or the complete information to which we have access the four marker genotypes information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients it proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically instead we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters for each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal euclidean distance in all cases the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci,

respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in april 2003 caused much concern and reaction refereed medical journals ever since have been rife with articles about sars the eventual containment and treatment of sars has seen a diminution of the massive media publicity and overt public concern however fears have recently surfaced about the potential for re emergence of sars in the near future as we confront the potential need to return to more stringent infection control measures once again this is an appropriate time to reflect on the ethical values that underlay the strict visitation restrictions imposed in hospitals in ontario during the sars outbreak and the moderate restrictions in place since sars this reflection will facilitate future decision making with respect to visitation restrictions our infectious disease colleagues are adamant that restricting the movement of people into and around the hospital setting are effective clinical and epidemiological strategies that will help protect both the vulnerable patient population and health care providers themselves who need to stay healthy so that they may care for their patients one might argue then that visitation restrictions are both enhancing and supportive of public health protection this position recognizes that there are times when public health protection overrides the protection of individual freedom it could be argued that visitation restrictions in light of a potential outbreak of a contagious disease are ethically sound because of the compelling need to protect public health however even when public health concerns trump individual liberties the ethical operationalization of this value would demand that those whose rights are being infringed need to be managed in an ethical and even handed manner so that they are not unfairly or disproportionately harmed by such measures 1 this is an important and far reaching consideration because sars caused collateral damage and we know that the implementation of visitation restrictions will have an impact on a broad range of individuals understandably those patients who were confirmed or suspected of being carriers of contagious pathogens were easily and directly identified however there were people who had not demonstrated any risk or epidemiological link to a contagious disease but who experienced quarantine restriction of movement inconvenience loss of pay and inability to access important and sometimes vital services within the health care system in fact there was a general trend within the populace toward avoiding meetings / gatherings as well as kissing hugging and even hand shaking clearly these restrictions are reflective of a loss of civil liberties in the general population and render expressions of caring difficult at a time when people may need them the most in a health care institution visitation restrictions not only affect inpatients but also have an impact on ambulatory patients who must come for diagnostic tests or interventions and who if deprived access might develop urgent or emergent conditions restrictions are likely to cause distress anxiety and increased complaints in fact on review of the university health network corporate complaint database sars 1 ( period march 28 april 20 2003 ) and sars 2 ( period may 12 august 10 2003 ) generated a 27 increase in complaints over the expected number of complaints for that time period specifically during this time period there would normally have been 770 calls of complaint but with sars 1 and 2 a total of 1052 calls of complaint were received it should be stressed that these data are over and above the complaints received at each site of the corporation which were not captured in the database ultimately this is a set of problems that must be managed with sensitivity and clarity ( nyhof young and colleagues unpublished data ) in view of the magnitude of implications of visitor restriction it is important that policy decisions at the micro or macro level consider issues of equity publicity transparency and the appeal process issues of equity must take into consideration the known facts from a scientific perspective as well as the range of approaches considered in terms of transparency and due diligence the rationale behind the policies and how they will be implemented should be as clear and unambiguous as possible feedback should be sought from those individuals who would be affected by visitation restrictions such as staff patients and family members the policy must be made accessible printed and broadly circulated throughout the hospital so that people understand the rules the rationale for those rules the processes available to them to assist them in living with those rules and ways to appeal in special circumstances visitation policy developers must realize that there may be exceptional circumstances that demand exceptional latitude the development of criteria for exceptionality must recognize the need for proportionality ensuring that criteria are relevant legitimate and necessary and should be applied without discrimination 1 furthermore to be consistent with expectations of transparency the criteria by which exceptionality to the rules of visitation restriction exists should also be published openly throughout the organization for staff patients and visitors from our experience with sars a corporate policy was developed and there was an expectation that there would be compliance with this corporate policy however it was also acknowledged that local patient needs would dictate more or less stringent adherence to these rules and that the degree of adherence might change quickly without the opportunity for broad notification for example although current policy allows for specific times of visitation and numbers of visitors per day a sudden outbreak might dictate a quick lockdown of the facility without patients or family members receiving prior notice a health care professional has a duty to care based on several ethical considerations 1 such as professional code of conduct intrinsic requirements of the work and the acceptance of risk as part of the decision to do a specific type of work part of this duty to care for patients encompasses a broader duty in that one must care for their family as well visitation restrictions impede this ability because health care providers find themselves in the awkward position of conveying very private personal messages between patients and family members of providing updates and of breaking bad news over the phone thus losing their ability to convey empathy or judge the amount of support required effectively moreover health care workers being in direct communication with patients and families bear the brunt of their anger and frustration regarding any restriction in visitation there is an implicit acceptance that reciprocity exists between the hospital organization and the individual staff member 1 to this end it is the organization that must accept responsibility for making rules and communicating them broadly to all staff patients and visitors similarly it is the responsibility of the organization to enforce compliance with these rules it is not the responsibility of staff whose primary responsibility is to discharge the duty of care to the patient the organization also has the responsibility of developing a set of criteria outlining exceptionality and a process to receive review and adjudicate requests a process must be developed ( together with appropriate resources ) so that staff members know who to access for support and are able to do this is in an easy and expeditious manner in the interests of the public good there may be times when information must be shared publicly thereby impinging on the rights of the individual to privacy and confidentiality with respect to restricted visitation an ethical argument could be made that visitation restrictions ( or latitude thereof ) can be instituted generally without specifically naming names although the vigilant observer might be able to identify a specific person from a changed application of the rule the organization cannot reasonably be expected to guard against every possible identification but every effort should be made to protect the individual from easy identification for example if a family is allowed to visit a patient whose death is presumed to be imminent ( within the next 24 hours ) then the patients identity should be protected by using privacy strategies efforts to protect the patients identity are consistent with the ethical value of protection of communities from undue stigmatization 1 given the risks associated with contagious pathogens and the easy mode of transmission globally it is important that there be consistency in management the ideal situation would be a consistent global approach to the management of each and every contagious pathogen the notion of universal management strategies is very sensible ( e g universal precautions with blood borne conditions such hiv ) however given the political and economic disparities across the world as well as the lack of knowledge ( particularly of newly evolving pathogens ) a standardized approach is not possible the experience of sars indicates that some patient populations require a level of vigilance that is more stringent than that required in others for example those individuals who reported recent travel to high risk areas and those who worked in quarantined or contaminated hospitals or who exhibited clear symptoms ( e g fever persistent cough ) were scrutinized with more vigilance and were in fact treated differently than other visitors until they were cleared through the screening process this type of variability in vigilance demands ethical management of differences and there is a need to guard against overt bias or discrimination creeping into the process it is difficult to expect that both standardization of approach and variability in approach can easily coexist but the operational challenge is to exercise awareness of the ethical values discussed above and the appropriate due diligence in the implementation of processes it is ethical to accept that public health protection trumps individual rights to liberal visitation the rationale for this position must be fully outlined to patients visitors and staff in responding to visitors who may be deprived of visitation it is ethical to recognize that there may be exceptional circumstances that demand exceptional latitude a set of criteria outlining exceptionality should be developed as should a process to receive review and adjudicate requests in the interests of equity an appeal process should be made explicit and transparent to all this information should be well publicized to staff patients and visitors in a consistent and sensitive manner every reasonable effort should be made to protect the individual patients identity and their specific health status should exceptionality be considered it is ethically the responsibility of the organization to enforce compliance with restricted visitation and a corporate department should be assigned this task although it is recognized that standardization in the application of visitation restrictions is necessary there is recognition that there may be circumstances that would require deviation from the corporate position the author has declared no competing interests sars = severe acute respiratory syndrome,

evaluation of an internet linked handheld computer critical care knowledge access system,,the rate of expansion of medical knowledge is increasing rapidly and it is frequently difficult for clinicians to keep abreast of important new literature for example several recently published randomized controlled trials in critical care have demonstrated mortality benefits 1 5 but uptake of new knowledge into clinical practice is often delayed 6 8 improving access to this knowledge base at the point of care may lead to better clinical decision making which could improve patient outcome reduce costs and optimize bed utilization 9 in critical care rapid access to medical reference information may be particularly important in facilitating timely management decisions and avoiding errors 10 computing technology can allow point of care access to up to date medical reference material 11 a study evaluating a mobile computerized cart to make evidence available to clinicians in an internal medicine setting 12 demonstrated that evidence based medicine was more likely to be incorporated into patient care when the computerized system was used because of their portability handheld devices may be more practical tools for disseminating knowledge to the point of care despite the popularity of handheld devices in medicine few studies have evaluated the usefulness of this technology 13 before widespread dissemination of this type of technology can be encouraged its impact must be thoroughly evaluated 14 in the present study we evaluated whether it would be feasible and effective to provide updateable reference information from a central academic centre to handheld computers used by critical care specialists in community hospitals a total of 17 intensivists at four community hospital intensive care units ( icus ) in the greater toronto area participated in the present prospective interventional study after training each physician was equipped with a handheld computing device ( palm m505 palm inc milpitas ca usa ) loaded with medical reference material pertinent to the critical care physician this information included a customized critical care information handbook ( critical care ) which was previously developed for use by residents and physicians at our centre ( additional file 1 ) commercially available medical reference software was also incorporated namely pepid ed ( pepid llc skokie il usa ) and medcalc the handheld devices were able to receive literature updates on a regular basis using customized software ( iqsync infiniq software mississauga ontario canada ) which accessed an internet based server using either a connection via desktop computer or infrared data transfer to a telephone modem ( fig 1 ) new information was sent to the handheld devices and appeared in a file called whats new these updates provided every 2 3 weeks comprised brief reviews of relevant new literature including a short summary a commentary and the article abstract all handheld devices were equipped with backup software that allowed the content to be rapidly restored in the event of a hardware failure ( backupbuddy vfs blue nomad software redwood city ca usa ) the devices were also equipped with software capable of generating a log of the applications used ( appusage benc software production slavonski brod croatia ) between september and november 2002 the handheld devices were distributed to participating physicians at which time they each received a 1 hour training session on the use of the handheld device and the internet link ( fig 2 ) after training the participants were able to utilize the devices in clinical practice for 12 months we provided 24 hour support by telephone and e mail with a website for independent review feasibility of the system was assessed by tracking physicians use of the handheld device and tracking their access of the individual handheld applications during the study period physicians who updated their handheld computers at least once a month for 6 months were identified as regular users a qualitative assessment of the system was achieved through surveys and focus group methodology participants completed surveys at baseline to identify their prior familiarity with handheld devices and at the end of the study period to evaluate subjectively the handheld reference system and the individual handheld applications survey data were scored on a 7 point scale in which poor scored 1 and excellent scored 7 an independent company ( the nrc + picker group markham canada ) conducted the focus group evaluations at the end of the intervention period to determine the perceived utility of the information system each hospital physician group participated in one focus group meeting information sources that physicians accessed to make clinical decisions were evaluated during simulated patient care scenarios completed in the physicians own icu utilizing a computerized patient simulator ( simman laerdal medical corporation wappingers falls ny usa ) each physician completed one scenario before the handheld device was introduced ( baseline scenario ) and one at the end of the intervention period ( final scenario ) when the handheld device could be used ( fig 2 ) a small pool of five scenarios with equivalent complexity was developed such that physicians would likely need to access information sources in order to make management decisions the scenarios involved unusual but important conditions namely thyroid storm myasthenia gravis methanol toxicity malaria and methemoglobinaemia they were allocated to study participants in such a way as to avoid participants from the same site receiving the same scenario at the same time point and to avoid repetition of scenarios among individual participants each scenario concluded with the physician writing admission orders for the simulated patient during the scenarios we tracked all medical reference sources utilized by the physicians who were encouraged to use a think aloud process 15 an audiovisual recording was made of the scenarios for later analysis and when the handheld was used real time screen capture was incorporated into the recording ( additional file 2 ) this allowed us to document which handheld applications were accessed the time taken to access information and the time taken to complete the scenario we developed an objective scoring system for the admission orders generated at each scenario the admission orders were assigned a score ( range 0 100 ) by a critical care physician ( sm ) and critical care pharmacist ( lb ) who were blinded as to whether the physician used the handheld device the scenario specific scoring system allocated points for all necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions weighted according to relative importance negative points were given for potentially harmful orders data are presented as median and interquartile range ( iqr ) and permutation tests were used for comparisons because numbers were small and not normally distributed the differences between the final and baseline admission order scores and the time to completion of scenarios were calculated for each participant a two sample permutation test was used to compare these differences between the group of physicians who chose to use the handheld in the final scenario and those who did not use the device admission order scores obtained for each of the five scenarios were compared outcomes were considered statistically significant at < 0 05 the sas system for window version 8 2 ( sas institute inc cary nc usa ) was used for all analyses focus groups were recorded transcribed verbatim and subsequently analyzed themes were identified and unique perspectives on key issues noted 16 the handheld information system functioned well during the study period tracking of the deployment of handhelds identified 10 regular users ( 59 ) four physicians ( 23 ) who used the system variably and three physicians ( 18 ) who never used their handheld device the regular users accessed the personal information management applications more commonly ( median 32 8 times / month iqr 28 3 126 8 ) than the medical software ( median 9 / month iqr 3 7 13 7 p = 0 028 ) although significant variation was noted ( table 1 ) baseline survey data identified that of the 17 critical care physicians participating 12 ( 71 ) had previous experience with handheld devices ( nine had used the palm operating system and three had used windows ce ) for a median duration of 1 year ( range 1 month to 3 8 years ) seven participants ( 41 ) reported using handhelds for accessing medical information before the study of the 16 final survey respondents seven ( 44 ) felt that the handheld system had had a positive impact on their clinical practice the handheld medical applications ( critical care whats new medcalc and pepid ) received similar ratings with overall evaluation scores ranging from 4 1 to 5 3 on the 7 point scale four focus group meetings involving a total of 13 participants ( 76 ) identified the benefits and barriers to use of handhelds for information access and made suggestions for improvement ( table 2 ) the overall impression of participants was that there is a role for handhelds for mobile information access but that in situations away from the bedside other electronic media such as desktop computers were preferable not all study physicians were able to participate in the simulated clinical scenarios on the pre assigned day fourteen physicians ( 82 3 ) participated in the baseline scenarios and 13 ( 76 5 ) in the final scenarios information sources utilized during the baseline scenarios included the internet ( 50 of participants e g medline searches and electronic textbooks ) textbooks ( 43 ) telephoning colleagues the icu pharmacist or poison control centre ( 71 ) and other sources such as pocket guides ( 21 ) in the final scenarios the handheld device was used as the primary source of information by eight participants ( 62 table 3 ) of 14 information searches on the handheld device 11 searches ( 79 ) were successful and the median time to access information was 19 s ( iqr 15 40 s ) the information sources of those participants not using the handheld device were similar to those in the baseline surveys ( table 3 ) analysis of the time to completion of the clinical scenarios demonstrated no significant difference between those physicians who used the handheld and those who did not ( 12 92 min iqr 10 73 16 62 min versus 15 5 min iqr 12 85 22 72 min respectively ) physicians who did not use their handheld device in the final clinical scenarios had similar scores to their baseline scenario scores ( median 60 0 iqr 40 0 60 0 versus 58 0 iqr 44 5 70 5 respectively ) in contrast an improvement in the final scenario score as compared with the baseline score was noted for those participants who chose to use the handheld device ( median 66 0 iqr 52 5 74 5 versus 44 8 iqr 30 5 54 5 respectively p = 0 018 fig 3 ) when scores recorded for each of the five clinical scenarios were compared no significant difference was noted reducing the likelihood that scenario assignment influenced outcomes this study demonstrates the feasibility of using an electronic knowledge translation system to provide high quality regularly updated medical reference information from a central academic centre to multiple peripheral users user acceptance of this technology was not uniform with just over half of the participants using their handheld devices to access information on a regular basis nevertheless the availability of point of care access to information may have improved the quality of clinical decision making although mobile computing devices have potential beneficial roles to play in clinical medicine few publications describe formal evaluation of this technology 13 because the present study was an early hypothesis generating evaluation of this technology multiple quantitative and qualitative outcomes were measured we generated novel data on the use of handheld devices in a clinical situation but the study has several limitations the number of physicians involved was relatively small with a significant proportion not utilizing the technology the allocation of clinical scenarios was not randomized because they were allocated predominantly to avoid using the same scenario at the same site and time point however the analysis performed compared participants who used the handheld with those who did not because it was not known which participant would use the handheld at the time of allocation of scenarios potential bias was minimized furthermore the scenarios appeared to be equivalent in difficulty because no difference was noted when scores for the individual scenarios were compared a confounding factor in the study was the outbreak of sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) from march to may 2003 which had a significant impact on the study icus 17 participants were advised to avoid using their handhelds during patient contact because of the potential to transmit infection and this affected continuity of the study had we not encountered this event utilization might have been higher the lack of universal acceptance of this technology is not surprising and may be due to a number of factors including inadequate training and the lack of familiarity with the technology 18 training is essential when introducing handheld computing technology 1920 and although all users underwent a training programme the surveys and focus groups indicated a need for improvement familiarity with handhelds is increasing with 33 of all canadian physicians and 53 of under 35 year olds using these devices in 2003 but these levels of utilization remain relatively low when compared with use of the internet at 88 21 increasing familiarity with the technology will probably increase acceptance of such a system other potential barriers to use of the handheld system may be addressed by the rapidly developing technology including improved screen resolution ease of data entry and wireless connectivity acceptance may be increased through the development of an all in one package on the handheld allowing additional functionality such as decision support billing electronic prescribing and communication the study demonstrated the potential role of an updateable handheld information system for knowledge translation in critical care rapid access to current clinical guidelines may be a valuable component of a comprehensive solution to reducing error and improving efficiency information access may be most beneficial in areas without full time critical care physicians particularly given the current imbalance between demand and supply with critical care physicians which is expected to worsen 910 recent recommendations highlight the importance of leveraging information technology to standardize practice and promote efficiency in critical care 10 handheld information access alone is unlikely to change clinical practice but it should be considered a component of an electronic knowledge translation system in many situations other media such as desktop or tablet computers may be preferable for information access although the study was carried out in a critical care environment such a system is probably applicable to other specialties in which clinicians are mobile and may not have ready access to a desktop computer ( for example anaesthesia emergency medicine home care ) this study provides insight into the potential impact of this technology in improving health care outcomes 14 nevertheless further study that builds on our findings is essential to determine how these new technologies can best be incorporated into the patient care setting a handheld computer system is feasible as a means of providing point of care access to medical reference material in the icu during this study acceptance of this system was variable and improved training and more advanced technology may be required to overcome some of the barriers we identified in clinical simulations use of such a system appeared to improve clinical decision making this study demonstrated that an updateable handheld computer information resource is a feasible means for providing point of care access to medical reference information in the icu acceptance of this system was variable and may be improved by enhanced training and newer technological innovations

their impact on critical care,,this series of articles provides regular surveillance of new technologies which may impact on critical care several countries have developed national horizon scanning systems to identify and monitor new health technologies there is variation in how these centres gather information but a consistent set of high priority sources has been identified 1 for the purposes of this article the outputs of major health technology assessment centres national regulatory authorities and recognized scientific news sources ( table 1 ) were systematically searched for developments relevant to acute and critical care this was combined with a manual medical literature search along key editorial themes subjectively selected for this issue point of care testing is a major emerging theme throughout the health sector encompassing both new diagnoses and monitoring of known diseases and their treatment areas of research range from the potentially lucrative markets for outpatient office based and patient self testing through to in hospital diagnostics which include both rapid access analysis of traditionally laboratory bound diagnostics and direct patient imaging both aspects are particularly relevant to critical care clinicians who rely on time sensitive diagnosis and treatment in a hyper acute setting an example of bedside imaging in cardiac assessment has already been cited in the first article of the present series 2 sample analysis meanwhile is rapidly developing to encompass bedside biochemical markers physiological homeostasis monitoring and novel ultra rapid forms of infectious disease diagnosis b type natriuretic peptide can be a rapid and effective marker of ventricular strain and heart failure 3 and can now be measured using a point of care diagnostic panel ( triage bnp test biosite inc san diego ca usa ) similar current and forthcoming technologies include rapid access d dimer assays for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism as part of a structured point of care algorithm 4 and unpublished early developments in stroke diagnostics validation and clinical trials of these technologies have taken place primarily in the emergency department setting but heart failure cerebrovascular accident and pulmonary embolism are all of added significance in the intensive care unit ( icu ) as both primary and acquired conditions rapid bedside diagnosis of such conditions with minimal need for intrahospital transport may be of great potential benefit to intensivists the importance of tight glucose control in sepsis is becoming well established 5 although work continues on refining the target range with a study of 4000 patients now in progress ( normoglycaemia in intensive care study anzics commencing 2004 ) the first major prospective study of tight glucose control in sepsis introduced a novel algorithm requiring frequent measurements 6 which raised concerns over patient safety and resource utilization in general icus point of care stick glucose testing is already prevalent but technology now exists for continuous in vivo glucose monitoring which although intended for ambulatory use could improve accuracy in the acute setting a subcutaneous interstitial glucose sensor system ( continuous glucose monitoring system medtronic minimed inc northridge ca usa ) was tested against clamp controlled hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic excursions in volunteers 7 it was shown to be closely correlated with reference analyzer results ( r2 = 0 91 p < 0 001 ) and highly responsive ( half time 4 0 1 0 min ) similarly another device ( glucoday a menarini diagnostics florence italy ) utilizing a 15 100 l micropump and a biosensor coupled with microdialysis to give a claimed response time of 2 min will reach european markets this year such devices may be incorporated into manual algorithms or they may potentially open the way to automated closed loop glucose control microbiological diagnosis within clinical laboratories has been advancing apace 8 polymerase chain reaction technology is well established but progressive refinements have made possible the rapid and near real time diagnosis of current novel or newly relevant pathogens including hiv and sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) techniques initially aimed at viruses because of their manageable size can now also be applied to bacteria and can be used for broad simultaneous screening of multiple pathogens ( pneumoplex prodesse milwaukee wi usa ) further refinements in microarrays and microfluidics are anticipated to bring handhand and point of care systems into use in the near future point of care and rapid laboratory based technologies will soon be able to elicit not only pathogen identity but also patterns of drug resistance developments include the use of adenylate kinase assay for accelerated laboratory based identification of drug resistant bacteria including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistant enterococci ( baclite acolyte biomedica salisbury uk ) point of care testing within emergency and critical care areas is likely to develop rapidly in the next 5 years but it will bring complications relating to quality control medicolegal liability certificated training for icu and other nonlaboratory staff increased cost and territoriality issues finally other bedside technologies that have recently been assessed include the use of handheld ultrasound devices to detect occult pneumothoraces which have been shown to have a higher sensitivity than chest radiography ( 48 8 versus 20 9 ) against a computed tomography standard 9 preliminary investigations suggest that handheld infrared pupillometry may be of clinical use in detecting midline cerebral shift in head injury patients 10 more procedure orientated assistance may become available from near infrared technology which has been piloted in a computerized bedside visualization device to aid venous cannulation 11 applicability to central venous cannulation has not been explored acquired bloodstream infection ( bsi ) in the icu is a serious complication a study of icu patients in calgary 12 demonstrated crude death rates of 45 among patients with icu acquired bsi as compared with 21 in those without ( p < 0 0001 ) s aureus was isolated in 18 of cases in the study cited above in this context the development of an antistaphylococcal vaccine ( staphvax nabi pharmaceuticals boca raton fl usa ) represents a promising new health technology 13 staphvax is currently in phase iii trials for end stage renal disease but phase ii trials are under way in postoperative and long hospital stay patients health technology assessment encompasses the best use of current health care devices as well as emerging technologies medical devices represent a prime infection hazard and us centers for disease control and prevention guidelines 14 cover the safe use of intravascular devices to minimize acquired bsi however more recent work demonstrates that the incidence of catheter related bsi may be significantly reduced by adding a further device needle free disinfectable connectors instead of three way stopcocks to the existing recommendations ( 0 7 infections / 1000 days versus 5 0 infections / 1000 days of catheter use p < 0 03 ) 15 clinical management of sepsis is normally outside the remit of this section of the journal however it is noteworthy that new mechanical technology has been applied to the direct treatment of sepsis rather than to cardiovascular or tissue perfusion monitoring a recent european multicentre open randomized phase ii trial 16 investigated the use of the endotoxin adsorber system en500 ( fresenius bad homburg germany ) in 145 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock due to suspected gram negative infection the study demonstrated a trend toward reduced icu stay and more rapid reduction in lipopolysaccharide levels but it failed to show any difference in outcome certain developments in this sector are pertinent to critical care isabel is a web based diagnostic decision support tool intended to provide diagnosis reminders and minimize missed diagnosis of critical disease processes it is currently in use in several uk and overseas hospitals with development supported by uk department of health funding followed by a commercial launch 17 the methodology is novel a commercial artificial intelligence inference engine ( autonomy cambridge uk ) is used to extract and structure information from standard paediatric textbooks and to generate diagnostic reminders from this knowledge base in response to unstructured free text clinical information the software has been under development for some time and was reviewed in this journal in 2002 18 but it is now being modified to encompass adult critical illness a review of decision support systems by the uk national institute of clinical excellence is pending there are political and medicolegal implications the isabel project was initially set up on a charitable basis by the parents of a child who survived a prolonged stay in paediatric intensive care after a missed diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis although the system is as yet little known among adult intensivists its technology is innovative and its proposed status as an online second opinion may give it together with similar expert systems a powerful consumerist resonance with patients carers and managers the uk national institute of clinical excellence findings should be monitored with interest by critical care providers more broadly the uk health service is currently in the grip of a globally unprecedented large scale national project for it ( npfit ) 19 structured as a series of private finance initiatives this ambitious programme will ultimately see in a host of regionally standardized patient information systems image storage and networked monitoring and audit systems linked to a national electronic patient record spine there are already concerns about timescale feasibility and funding broader concern is growing about catastrophic and unpredictable emergent behaviour in massively interconnected information technology ( it ) systems which are rapidly becoming too complex to test or accurately model 20 emergent behaviour in complex systems has already been explored in popular fictional media in which predicted outcomes are spectacular but somewhat discouraging 21 however even without quite such an apocalyptic scenario we may well see a rising incidence of total system failures due to unpredictable nonlinear behaviour that is major collapses triggered by small unforeseen causes in the light of recent north american power outages and destructive computer failures in the uk social service and tax systems emergent behavour must now be considered a clear and present threat to our increasingly networked health services and their supporting infrastructure levels of concern are such that the uk government is funding a 10 million research programme into it complexity and catastrophic failures how much of this is relevant to critical care or to other countries first icus provide complex time sensitive care to highly dependent patients they therefore require the successful convergence of multiple hospital systems which makes them uniquely vulnerable to the consequences of system failures whether in diagnostics supplies information flow or indeed electrical power second the currently stated uk npfit vision is that all icu subsystems including networked monitoring telemetry and audit systems will eventually be integrated into npfit with control over equipment selection and data collection handed to the regional private sector consortia and to national audit bodies clinician engagement and choice may not feature highly on the agenda and there are clear concerns over the future of independent research and audit finally clinicians from other countries would be well advised to follow such developments because the uk is not unique in its desire to radically modernize and standardize health it starting with a drive toward electronic patient records in april 2004 president bush issued an executive order calling for us national implementation of electronic medical records within 10 years from a current baseline of 19 implementation in a series of presidential speeches he went on to further define health care objectives substantially similar to the uk npfit agenda 22 therefore this represents another area in which political and technological developments outside the icu may have a direct impact on clinical practice and patient safety and intensivists are strongly recommended to consult early and engage with those driving their local and national health economy a variety of emerging technologies are examined here very few of these are designed or marketed to be specific to intensive care and few are traditional devices that can be

mcfmxqp2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1065257/,"emily manktelow, kazuhiro shigemoto, ian brierley",characterization of the frameshift signal of edr a mammalian example of programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting,,programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting ( hereafter frameshifting for brevity ) is a translational control mechanism that allows the production of a specific ratio of gene products from two overlapping open reading frames the relative quantities of which depend upon the frameshift efficiency at that particular site frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein synthesis where in response to elements in the mrna the ribosome switches from the zero reading frame to the 1 frame ( in the 5 direction ) at a defined position and translation continues in the new frame the frameshift signals of this class first described in retroviruses ( 12 ) have subsequently been found ( mainly ) in other virus genomes and in escherichia coli insertional elements reviewed in ( 3 6 ) the mrna signals that promote frameshifting comprise a slippery sequence where the frameshift takes place and a 3 stimulatory rna structure separated from the slippery sequence by a short spacer region the heptanucleotide slippery sequence typically contains consecutive homopolymeric triplets ( xxxyyyz ) with the ribosome bound trnas decoding the p and a site codons slipping from the zero frame ( x xxy yyz ) to the 1 frame ( xxx yyy ) studies of frameshifting in eukaryotic systems have indicated that x can be any nucleotide y is almost always a or u and z any nucleotide but g ( although the yyz codon is often aag in prokaryotic systems ) efficient frameshifting also requires the presence of the 3 stimulatory rna beginning 5 9 nt downstream of the slippery sequence at some sites a simple stem loop structure appears to be necessary and sufficient for frameshifting but more commonly an rna pseudoknot structure is present these are h ( hairpin ) type pseudoknots ( 7 ) although some viral pseudoknots have also been described as kissing hairpins ( 89 ) the mechanism of frameshifting is not fully understood although a number of models have been proposed to explain how the interaction of the ribosome with the stimulatory rna leads to a realignment of the trnas decoding the slippery sequence into the 1 frame ( 10 ) and references therein computer assisted database screens have highlighted the potential for 1 frameshifting in conventional cellular genes ( 11 13 ) but only two examples with obvious biological relevance have been identified to date the first is present in the e coli dnax gene encoding the and subunits of dna polymerase iii holoenzyme the synthesis of the protein is by frameshifting which directs ribosomes to a premature stop codon while the longest form ( ) is translated by continued standard decoding ( 1415 ) the frameshift occurs at the slippery sequence aaaaaag by simultaneous slippage of both p and a site trnalys species from the zero ( a aaa aag ) to the 1 frame ( aaa aaa ) ( 1617 ) this process requires two stimulatory signals in the mrna a shine dalgarno like sequence 10 nt upstream of the slippery sequence and a stem loop structure 5 nt downstream of it ( 1819 ) the second example present in the mouse embryonal carcinoma differentiation regulated ( edr ) gene was described more recently ( 20 ) edr and the human orthologue peg10 paternally expressed 10 ( 21 ) are single copy genes located on mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 7 respectively high levels of edr are seen during mouse embryogenesis with distinct spatial and temporal patterns of mrna expression observed in the developing musculo skeletal system edr thus appears to play a crucial role in mammalian development although its exact function is yet to be determined ( 20 ) the normal function of the peg10 protein is also uncertain although it is associated with the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma ( 22 ) the edr gene has two long partially overlapping reading frames ( rf1 and rf2 ) with a likely slippery sequence ( gggaaac ) within the overlap region and in the appropriate reading frame the signal is poorly characterized but in vitro frameshift assays indicate that 30 of ribosomes change frame within the rf1 / rf2 overlap region ( 20 ) with gggaaac as the site of frameshifting the gene would encode a 37 kda non frameshift product ( rf1 ) by normal translation and a 113 kda fusion protein ( rf1 rf2 ) by frameshifting rf1 contains a putative zinc binding domain of the cchc subclass with a high content of basic amino acids commonly found in retroviral gag proteins whereas the protein encoded by rf2 contains a consensus motif for an aspartyl protease catalytic site thus the organization is reminiscent of a retroviral gag / pro overlap and suggests that the edr frameshift signal is of retroviral origin nevertheless current models of the edr stimulatory rna ( 20 ) do not resemble closely the kind of structures that have been seen previously at retroviral frameshift signals reviewed in ( 2324 ) as the first eukaryotic cellular example of 1 frameshifting it is of interest to ascertain whether edr represents a new class of frameshift signal in this study we have used site directed mutagenesis and rna structure probing to characterize the edr signal we first confirmed the functionality and magnitude of the signal and confirmed a role for the gggaaac motif subsequently we derived a model of the edr stimulatory rna and assessed its similarity to those stimulatory rnas found at viral frameshift sites we found that the structure is an rna pseudoknot quite different from the one proposed previously ( 20 ) but possessing features typical of retroviral frameshifter pseudoknots from these experiments we conclude that the edr signal and by inference the peg10 orthologue do not represent a novel cellular class of programmed 1 ribosomal frameshift signal but rather are similar to viral examples albeit with some interesting features site specific mutagenesis was carried out by a procedure based on that of kunkel ( 25 ) as described previously ( 26 ) mutants were identified by dideoxy sequencing of single stranded templates ( 27 ) sequencing through g + c rich regions was facilitated by replacing dgtp with deaza gtp in the sequencing mixes the edr frameshift region was amplified from plasmid psp64t / edr ( 20 ) a 1230 nt region between mrna positions 631 and 1861 was amplified using pfu dna polymerase ( promega ) and forward and reverse primers respectively 5 tacatgccatgggtgctgcagcagcccctatc 3 and 5 tagtacaagcttccggcagcagagtcggcagta 3 the pcr product was digested with ndei and hindiii and cloned into plasmid pkt0 ( 28 ) to create pkt0 / edr ( figure 1 ) plasmid pkt0 / edr / t3 was prepared from pkt0 / edr by inserting the sequence 5 aattaaccctcactaaaggga 3 at a position 33 nt upstream of the start of the gggaaac slippery sequence this introduced a unique bacteriophage t3 rna polymerase promotor all plasmid junctions were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of single stranded templates rescued from e coli jm101 plasmids for in vitro transcription were prepared using a commercial kit ( wizardplus sv miniprep promega ) in vitro transcription reactions employing the bacteriophage sp6 rna polymerase were carried out essentially as described by melton et al ( 29 ) and included the synthetic cap structure 7megpppg ( new england biolabs ) to generate capped mrna product rna was recovered by a single extraction with phenol / chloroform / isoamyl alcohol ( 49 49 2 ) followed by precipitation in ethanol in the presence of 5 m ammonium acetate the rna pellet was dissolved in water and the remaining unicorporated nucleotide triphosphates removed by sephadex g 50 chromatography rna was recovered by ethanol precipitation dissolved in water and checked for integrity by electrophoresis on 1 ( w / v ) agarose gels containing 0 1 ( w / v ) sds in ribosomal frameshift assays purified mrnas were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( rrl ) as described previously ( 26 ) translation products were analysed on sds 15 ( w / v ) polyacrylamide gels according to the standard procedures ( 30 ) the relative abundance of non frameshifted and frameshifted products on the gels was determined by direct measurement of 35s methionine incorporation using a packard instant imager 2024 and adjusted to take into account the differential methionine content of the products the frameshift efficiencies quoted are the average of at least three independent measurements which varied by < 10 i e a measurement of 30 frameshift efficiency was between 27 and 33 the calculations of frameshift efficiency take into account the differential methionine content of the various products rnas for secondary structure probing were prepared by in vitro transcription of ndei cut pkt0 / edr / t3 using bacteriophage t3 rna polymerase transcription reactions were on a 200 l scale and contained 20 g plasmid dna 2 5 mm of each rntp and 200 u of t3 rna polymerase ( promega ) in a buffer containing 40 mm tris ph 8 15 mm mgcl2 and 5 mm dtt after 3 h at 37 c 100 u of dnase i was added and the incubation continued for a further 30 min nucleic acids were harvested by extraction with phenol / chloroform ( 1 1 ) and ethanol precipitation dna fragments were removed by sephadex g 50 chromatography and the rna transcripts concentrated by ethanol precipitation the rna was quantified by spectrophotometry and its integrity checked by electrophoresis on a 2 ( w / v ) agarose gel containing 0 1 sds transcripts ( 10 g ) were 5 end labelled with 33p atp using a standard dephosphorylation rephosphorylation strategy ( 31 ) purified from 6 acrylamide urea gels and dissolved in water the structure probing experiments followed the general principles outlined by others ( 32 34 ) all reactions contained 10 50 000 c p m 5 end labelled rna transcript rnase probing reactions were carried out in 50 l reaction volumes containing 50 g carrier e coli rrna ( sigma ) enzymatic probing reactions were carried out on ice for 20 min rnase cl3

carrier rrna dried in a desiccator and redissolved in 10 l of 2 m imidazole ph 7 containing 40 mm nacl and 10 mm mgcl2 after incubation at 37 c for 2 4 h the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 l of a fresh solution of 2 ( w / v ) lithium perchlorate in acetone the rna was recovered by centrifugation washed with acetone dried dissolved in water and prepared for gel loading as above all structure probing gels included an alkaline hydrolysis ladder as a size marker prepared by dissolving the dried pellet from 3 l of end labelled rna and 10 g carrier rrna in 3 l of 22 5 mm nahco3 2 5 mm na2co3 and boiling for 2 min after the addition of an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer and heating to 80 c for 3 min the sample was loaded immediately onto the gel the 5 and 3 boundaries of the edr frameshift signal were not characterized in the previous study ( 20 ) but we began our analysis with the assumption that the 5 boundary is the gggaaac heptamer located within the rf1 / rf2 overlap region a 1230 bp portion of the edr gene containing this slippery sequence and flanked by substantial lengths of open reading frame was cloned by pcr into the expression vector pkt0 ( 28 ) ( see materials and methods ) to generate pkt0 / edr ( figure 1 ) this plasmid contains a bacteriophage sp6 ( and t7 ) promoter for the generation of in vitro transcripts and provides an optimized ( kozak ) initiation codon for the translation of the cloned edr segment the cloned pcr product was sequenced to confirm that no errors had been introduced into the edr sequence to assess crudely the extent to which 3 sequences were required for frameshifting a series of run off transcripts containing varying lengths of edr sequence were prepared following digestion of the plasmid with ndei avrii hindiii or bamhi and transcription with sp6 rna polymerase ( figure 1 ) the mrnas were translated in the rrl in vitro translation system and the products analysed by sds / page ( figure 2 ) frameshifting was observed in all cases with each mrna showing an efficiency of 30 ( hereafter the wild type efficiency ) in good agreement with the value obtained by shigemoto et al ( 20 ) the sizes of the non frameshifted and frameshifted species were consistent with those expected following frameshifting at the rf1 / rf2 overlap region ( see legend to figure 2 ) as the mrna from the ndei digested plasmid ( linearized 105 bp downstream of the slippery sequence ) stimulated wild type levels of frameshifting subsequent investigations focussed on regions upstream of this restriction site to further delineate the essential sequences in frame deletions of 24 63 or 90 nt were introduced into pkt0 / edr in the region between the gggaaac motif and the ndei site ( figure 3a ) the plasmids were linearized with hindiii before in vitro transcription and translation as shown in figure 3b efficient frameshifting was observed only with pkt0 / edr / 24 nt hence the stimulatory rna is in fact longer than that proposed in the original study ( 20 ) ( figure 3a emboldened bases ) with a 3 boundary located between the 5 edge of the deletions of pkt0 / edr / 63 and 24 in addition to the non frameshifted and frameshifted species an additional longer product was seen in these translation reactions ( figure 3b asterisk ) and in fact in all translations of pkt0 / edr to a greater or lesser extent the identity of this product is uncertain it is unlikely to be an alternative frameshift product since its size was unaffected by changes in the length of the mrna downstream of the frameshift site however given that its intensity paralleled that of the non frameshifted product and its size was roughly double that of the non frameshifted product it may represent a stable dimer the results of the deletion analysis prompted a re evaluation of the folding possibilities within the rna downstream of the slippery sequence scrutiny of potential base pairing interactions within this extended region indicated the potential for the formation of an rna pseudoknot structure shown in figure 4b in comparison with the previous models of shigemoto et al ( 20 ) ( figure 4a ) the proposed pseudoknot is positioned 5 nt downstream of the gggaaac sequence and contains two relatively long stems linked by loops of three ( loop 1 ) and nine ( loop 2 ) nucleotides stem 1 can be subdivided into two regions ( 1a and 1b ) separated by a 3 nt bulge in the second arm to test our model of the edr frameshift signal site directed mutagenesis was carried out the mutants fell into four groups ( i ) changes in the putative slippery sequence gggaaac ( ii ) destabilizing and restabilizing mutations within the predicted stem regions 1a 1b and 2 ( iii ) a mutation that deleted the bulge triplet between stems 1a and 1b and ( iv ) a mutation that changed the central seven ( of nine ) nucleotides in loop 2 to their complementary watson crick bases figure 5 shows the mutations ( m1 m12 ) introduced into the frameshift region of pkt0 / edr ( figure 5a ) in vitro translations of the mutant constructs ( figure 5b mrnas derived from hindiii cut plasmids ) and a summary of the frameshift efficiencies measured for each construct ( figure 5c ) as before the sizes of the non frameshifted and frameshift species expected from these mrnas were 29 and 45 kda respectively the two independent mutations created within the putative slippery sequence had the second base of each homopolymeric triplet changed to a c residue ( m1 and m2 ) these changes would reduce the ability of the trnas decoding this sequence to slip into the 1 reading frame and consistent with this each change reduced the frameshifting efficiency ( figure 5 ) as seen with other frameshift signals the mutation in the second homopolymeric triplet ( gggacac m1 ) decoded in the ribosomal a site during the frameshift was highly inhibitory ( frameshifting was essentially abolished ) whereas the reduction in efficiency with the p site change ( gcgaaac m2 ) was less dramatic ( a 4 fold reduction ) these data are entirely consistent with the belief that the gggaaac stretch is indeed the site of the frameshift in edr and confirm the earlier observations of shigemoto et al ( 20 ) analysis of the proposed stem regions involved the introduction of complementary and compensatory changes within stems 1a 1b and 2 three mutations were prepared for each stem two of these were destabilizing mutations introduced into each arm of the relevant stem by changing three central base pairs to their complementary watson crick bases the third was a double mutation leading to a pseudowild type structure in which both changes were made and should be compensatory as shown in figure 5 destabilization of any stem reduced frameshifting efficiency ( m3 m4 m6 m7 m9 and m10 ) but frameshifting was restored in the double mutant pseudowild type constructs ( m5 m8 and m11 ) supporting the belief that the stems form and are required for frameshifting however there was some stem specific variation in the magnitude by which frameshifting was reduced by stem destabilization and the extent to which frameshifting was restored in the double mutants for stem 1a the reduction in frameshift efficiency after disruption of individual arms was quite modest ( 2 5 fold for the 1st arm 6 fold for the 2nd arm ) but frameshifting efficiency was restored to close to that of the wild type in the double mutant construct ( m5 25 6 ) disruption of stem 1b in the same manner also led to a reduction in frameshifting efficiency but more dramatically with frameshifting reduced 15 fold for either arm as with the stem 1a double mutant frameshift efficiency was restored to close to that of the wild type value with the stem 1b pseudowild type construct ( m8 24 6 ) disruption of stem 2 was also inhibitory with efficiency values of 2 for mutations in the individual arms however although the double mutant construct showed a rise in efficiency in comparison with the single mutants frameshifting was restored only to about half that of the wild type construct ( m11 16 5 ) the presence of the aca bulge in stem 1 was of interest as a triplet bulge has been observed in the frameshift stimulatory rna of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv 1 ) and shown to contribute to frameshifting although the bulge is considered to be a component of a stem loop stimulatory rna in this system ( 35 ) however we found that deletion of the bulge had a very minor effect on edr frameshifting reducing the efficiency by only a few percent ( m13 26 8 ) the final mutation concerned loop 2 in a number of frameshift stimulating pseudoknots an adenosine rich triplex formed between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 has been described and contributes to frameshifting ( 23243637 ) a conserved 5 aacaa 3 motif in such loops has its bases rotated by varying degrees to allow interactions with bases on both strands in the minor groove of stem 1 it is an rna specific feature with each interaction involving a hydrogen bond formed from a ribose 2 hydroxyl group loop 2 of the proposed edr pseudoknot is relatively a rich ( five of nine bases ) and includes a 5 aacga 3 stretch to assess whether loop 2 stem 1 interactions may occur in edr the central seven bases of loop 2 were changed to their watson crick complementary nucleotides and frameshifting measured a modest reduction in frameshifting was observed ( m12 23 2 ) but not so dramatic as to suggest a major role for stem 1 loop 2 interactions in this pseudoknot at least those mediated by runs of loop adenosines since only one loop 2 adenosine remains in this mutant the mutagenesis data provided strong support for our model of the edr frameshift region but it was important to confirm the main features by rna structure mapping to facilitate this a bacteriophage t3 promotor was inserted into pkt0 / edr 33 nt upstream of the slippery sequence ( figure 1 ) the plasmid linearized with ndei and a 130 nt t3 transcript ( encompassing the frameshift region ) prepared this was end labelled with 33p atp gel purified and subjected to chemical and enzymatic digestion before analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels four enzymatic probes were used rnases cl3 t1 and u2 which preferentially cleave single stranded c g and a residues respectively and rnase cv1 which targets double stranded and stacked bases the chemical probes imidazole and lead acetate were also employed which show specificity for single stranded regions in these experiments the mg2 + level was kept at 2 mm which is the approximate concentration of this ion in rrl ( 38 ) representative structure probing gels are shown in figure 6 and a summary is shown in figure 7 the structure probing data were strongly supportive of the pseudoknot model of figure 4 the cleavage pattern of imidazole especially was highly consistent with the model with cleavage occurring only within loops 1 and 2 at the very ends of the stems and in the aca bulge of stem 1 lead acetate gave a similar cleavage pattern although there were more cuts at the ends of the stems taking all of the probing reagents into account the pattern of reactivities of stem 2 loop 1 and loop 2 matched the structure prediction very closely stem 2 appeared to be very stable in comparison with the same region of other frameshift stimulating pseudoknots we have studied ( 39 41 ) it was cleaved almost exclusively by the double strand specific rnase cv1 being unreactive with single stranded enzymatic probes and showing only occasional weak cleavage with single stranded chemical probes the loops also showed appropriate reactivity both were cleaved by single stranded chemical probes and loop 2 also by single strand specific enzymes only c89 of loop 2 exhibited any consistent cleavage with cv1 and this may indicate some base stacking although loop 1 was not reactive to single strand specific enzymatic probes this probably reflects a reduced accessibility of enzymes to this short loop the most unexpected features of this stimulatory rna were the atypical cleavage pattern of stem 1 and the paucity of cleavages in the slippery sequence / spacer region the assignment of cleavages in these areas was complicated by a strong compression effect in the gels ( see figure 6a between bases 40 and 60 ) presumably arising from stable base pairing which was not completely relieved ( although much improved ) by running reactions on highly denaturing gels containing 20 formamide ( figure 6b ) nevertheless we were able to assign almost all of the reactivities in this region and it was noticeable that stem 1 especially stem 1a showed susceptibility to cleavage by single strand specific enzymatic probes notably rnase t1 at residues g80 82 similarly rnase cl3 a c specific reagent also showed cleavage at some of the c residues in stem 1 although it can be argued that the the aca bulge in stem 1 would introduce some deformation of the ( presumably ) a form helix and increase accessibility of adjacent bases to enzymatic probes we did not see an increased access of chemical probes arguing against a severe bulge induced destabilization of stem 1a it may be that stem 1a exists in equilibrium with another conformation and one such possibility is shown in figure 7b in this alternative model the first arm of stem 1a is proposed to pair with an upstream region ( g35 g40 ) displacing the second arm of stem 1a and the bulge triplet into loop 2 some features of this alternative model are attractive e g the cleavage of g80 82 by rnase t1 is rationalized as these residues would be located in loop 2 similarly the limited reactivity of the slippery sequence and spacer region to single strand cleavage reagents could be attributed to the fact that much of the region is folded into a hairpin however the alternative model also has flaws most noticeably that the pattern of reactivities of the bases in the second arm of stem 1a is not fully consistent with their location in loop 2 these bases should show increased sensitivity to lead acetate and imidazole and reduced cv1 cleavage neither of which was observed in addition one might expect that the sensitivity of g80 82 to rnase t1 would be similar to that of the other gs in loop 2 ( g86 and g90 ) which also was not the case based on the mutational analysis ( figure 5 ) and the chemical probing data we favour the idea that stem 1a folds according to the original prediction but shows breathing or flips occasionally into an alternative conformation ( perhaps the one described above ) this behaviour might account for the fact that destabilization of the stem did not reduce frameshifting as dramatically as those mutations that destabilized stem 1b or stem 2 ( figure 5 ) nevertheless it remains difficult to explain the strong reactivity of the gs ( to rnase t1 ) in the second arm of stem 1a it may be that unusual structural features are present that promote rnase t1 cleavage this idea is not without precedent structure probing of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) frameshift stimulating pseudoknot ( s pennell and i brierley unpublished data ) functional derivatives of this pseudoknot ( 4041 ) and a functional derivative of the rsv pseudoknot ( 39 ) has also revealed unexpected rnase t1 reactivity towards apparently base paired g residues although in these pseudoknots at the top of stem 2 in this study the secondary structure of the edr frameshift signal was investigated using site directed mutagenesis and rna structure probing the results obtained clearly demonstrate that the stimulatory rna downstream of the slippery sequence folds into an rna pseudoknot which although different from an earlier study ( 20 ) undoubtedly resembles the frameshift promoting pseudoknots of virus signals the edr frameshift site comprises a slippery sequence gggaaac a 5 nt spacer region and a relatively large pseudoknot ( in viral terms ) with 10 bp in stem 1 9 in stem 2 and loops of 3 ( loop1 ) and 9 ( loop 2 ) nucleotides in comparison with viral frameshift signals edr does not fit into a specific category but has hallmarks of different viruses the possession of relatively long pseudoknot stems especially stem 2 is a feature of the frameshift signals present at the pro / pol overlap of the retroviruses human t cell lymphotrophic virus ( htlv ) types 1 and 2 simian t cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 and bovine leukaemia virus and also of the coronaviruses although in these viruses the pseudoknots are accompanied by the slippery sequence uuuaaac rather than gggaaac ( 2642 44 ) in terms of loop lengths edr resembles most closely those pseudoknots found at the gag / pro overlap of the retroviruses maedi visna virus mason pfizer monkey virus feline immunodeficiency virus and simian retrovirus ( srv ) types 1 and 2 which possess relatively short loops and also employ the slippery sequence gggaaac ( 42 ) the loops of the edr pseudoknot are short but sufficiently long to span the stems ( 737 ) that we have identified the entire frameshift region seems likely from the results of our mutational analysis and from phylogenetic sequence comparisons in figure 7a nucleotides within and surrounding the pseudoknot that differ in the human orthologue peg10 are shown as can be seen almost all of the sequence variation occurs before the slippery sequence and immediately following stem 2 four nucleotide differences are present within the frameshift region but of these only one is likely to have an effect on pseudoknot function namely the g to a transition at the top of stem 2 of the other three changes one is within the stem 1 bulge and the other two in loop 2 as we have shown experimentally that the bulge in stem 1 is not required for frameshifting and that most of the sequence of loop 2 can be changed without consequence it seems that these changes are in neutral regions the stem 2 transition itself would only affect the ultimate stem 2 base pair and would likely have only a modest effect on frameshift efficiency from the perspective of phylogenetics it will be interesting to see whether edr orthologues are present in other mammalian species this will be informative in assessing the conservation of the pseudoknot and the stage in mammalian evolution at which the edr gene was acquired an unexpected feature of the edr pseudoknot was the marked accessibility of single strand specific enzymatic reagents to stem 1a in the structure probing experiments in the discussion of these data in the results section above this accessibility was hypothesized to be a consequence of a relative instability of stem 1a or the presence of a specific stem 1 conformation highly reactive to single stranded enzymatic probes such as rnase t1 and cl3 in related investigations of the ibv ( 4045 ) srv 1 ( 31 ) and rsv pseudoknots ( 39 ) stem 2 rather than stem 1 proved to be more sensitive to single stranded probes and possessed unusual susceptibility to rnase t1 ( cl3 was not used in these studies ) another difference was highlighted in our mutational analysis of the edr pseudoknot where a complementary change that destabilized the first arm of stem 1a still retained about two fifths of the wild type frameshifting efficiency ( figure 5 m3 12 2 ) in most models of ribosomal frameshifting a ribosomal pause is proposed to occur upon encounter of the pseudoknot perhaps because of a failure to unwind the pseudoknot efficiently and this pause occurs while the decoding centre is over the slippery sequence in constructs with a stem 1 destabilization one would expect frameshifting to be greatly reduced since the ribosome would translate further into the structure ( since stem 1 affords less resistance ) and fail to pause or pause at an inappropriate place certainly in the ibv srv 1 and rsv pseudoknots ( cited above ) destabilization of stem 1 has generally proven to be highly inhibitory in comparison with equivalent changes in stem 2 the substantial frameshift efficiency engendered by the m3 mutant may simply indicate the adoption of an alternative ( fortuitous ) conformation that partially restores stem 1 function however it may also highlight a mechanistic aspect of edr frameshifting pointing towards a different contribution of the stems to ribosomal pausing and / or a different pathway of unwinding during the frameshift process ( 2324 ) perhaps in edr stem 2 rather than stem 1 is critical in determining the site of pausing or the rate of initial unwinding of the pseudoknot if this is the case the stability of stem 1 may be less crucial further work is required to ascertain the relative contribution of the two stems to frameshifting in this system a detailed analysis of related structures ( e g the htlv 1 pro / pol frameshift signal ) may also prove to be valuable several virus pathogens utilize 1 ribosomal frameshifting including the retrovirus hiv 1 ( 46 ) the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov ( 47 ) and numerous plant pathogens for example see ( 484950 ) frameshifting signals have thus been considered as targets for antiviral intervention ( 5152 ) the existence of related signals in eukaryotic cellular genes however would potentially complicate the design of or even prevent the use of such therapies particularly if the cellular frameshifting signal ( s ) was structurally similar to the virus examples the report of frameshifting in the mouse edr gene provided the first opportunity to characterize such a cellular signal we have demonstrated here that the edr signal resembles viral examples closely with a characteristic slippery sequence spacer pseudoknot organization thus the similarity of parts of the edr coding sequence to the gag / pro region of retroviral genomes extends to the maintenance of a retrovirus like frameshifting signal given this and the possibility that other retrovirus like motifs have been subsumed into mammalian genes and retained a role for frameshifting antiviral agents that target this process may have previously unanticipated consequences on cellular metabolism in uninfected cells,

one common rna folding motifs is a pseudoknot the folding back of a single stranded rna onto itself to form two helical structures with single stranded loops joining them ( 2 ) many such structures can be inferred from rna sequences and frameshifting function has been demonstrated for some of these reviewed in ( 3 5 ) however though much theoretical progress has been made in understanding how mrna pseudoknots promote efficient 1 ribosomal frameshifting ( 6 ) a complete understanding of this mechanism remains untested programmed 1 ribosomal frameshift signals are typically divided into three components from 5 to 3 these are ( i ) a slippery site in the form n nnw wwh where n must be a stretch of any three identical nucleotides where w is either three a or u residues and h is a c or u ( spacing indicates the unshifted zero frame ) ( ii ) a spacer region and ( iii ) an mrna structural element most often a pseudoknot the general model posits that upon encountering the mrna pseudoknot an elongating ribosome is forced to pause such that the anticodons of its a and p site trnas are base paired with the zero frame codons of the slippery site the nature of the trna mrna interactions is such that a relative slip of 1 nucleotide still allows base pairing in the non wobble positions the slippage occurs during the ribosomal pause and it has been shown that changes affecting ribosome pause times affect frameshift efficiencies reviewed in ( 7 ) an important observation is that even though mrna pseudoknots and energetically equivalent stem loop structures appear to promote ribosome pausing with equal effectiveness mrna pseudoknots are more efficient at promoting 1 prf ( 8 ) our 9 a model ( 6 ) provided a refinement of the original simultaneous slippage ( 910 ) model of frameshifting by suggesting that rather than the entire ribosome having to slip one base in the 5 direction slippage could be accomplished by moving the small section of mrna in the downstream tunnel by one base in the 3 direction we have proposed that this is accomplished by the bulky and difficult to unwind mrna pseudoknot structures becoming wedged in the downstream entrance tunnel of the ribosome preventing the downstream region of the mrna from being pulled into the ribosome by the equivalent of one base during the accommodation step of elongation this blockage would introduce tension into the spacer region which could be resolved by unpairing the mrna from the trnas allowing the mrna to slip 1 nt backwards resulting in a net shift of reading frame by 1 base though the 9 a model provides a partial explanation for why mrna pseudoknots promote programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting ( 1 prf ) more efficiently than simple stem loop structures it does not answer the question of how the mrna pseudoknot directs the ribosome to pause at the correct position along the mrna a complementary torsional restraint model addresses this issue ( 11 ) when a stem loop structure is unwound by an elongating ribosome unwinding of the stem forces the loop to rotate since a simple stem loop is not restrained the loop can rotate freely and only the base pairs within the stem resist ribosomal movement and thus the potential energy of unwinding should be distributed along the length of stem 1 ( figure 1a ) however if the loop is anchored or restrained as it is in a pseudoknot by stem 2 since the intrinsic ribosomal helicase is processive ( 12 ) stem 1 cannot be fully unwound until stem 2 is first denatured mechanically as the ribosome begins to unwind the base of stem 1 stem 2 forces the supercoiling in the remainder of stem 1 providing extra resistance to ribosome movement at some specific point the resistance to ribosome movement provided by the supercoiling counteracts the forward movement of the ribosome increasing the likelihood that the ribosome will stop at a precise point along the mrna energetically since full unwinding of stem 1 is dependent on complete denaturation of stem 2 the potential energy of unwinding of the pseudoknot structure should similarly be directed toward one point viewed either mechanically or energetically this point is where ribosomes will be directed to specifically pause on the mrna if it occurs with the trnas in ribosomal a and p sites positioned at the slippery site then frameshifting is stimulated this is summarized in figure 1b the efficiency of 1 prf can thus be viewed as a function of ( i ) the fraction of ribosomes paused over the slippery site and ( ii ) the rate at which the structure can be denatured there is increasing evidence from single molecule experiments that unfolding occurs in quick rips at a particular force ( 13 ) suggesting that in the case of unfolding pseudoknots frameshifting efficiency is related to both the energy barriers to unfolding the pseudoknot structure and the resistance of the structure against the force of the ribosome in the context of the torsional restraint model this resistance is dependent on the ability of stem 2 to remain intact while stem 1 is being unwound there is experimental data that indirectly support this model ( i ) disruption of the first 3 bp of stem 1 which would displace the ribosomes pause site to a point 3 of the slippery site has been shown to eliminate frameshifting ( 14 ) ( ii ) destabilizing stem 2 which would allow it to be unwound more readily has been shown to result in decreased frameshifting efficiency ( 15 17 ) ( iii ) replacing bulges in stem 1 with base pairs would increase the energy required to unwind the first three bases and a longer ribosomal pause over the slippery site would follow yielding increased efficiencies in 1 frameshifting ( 1518 ) ( iv ) destabilizing the base of stem 1 by replacing g c base pairs with a u pairs decreases 1 frameshifting efficiencies ( 1920 ) ( v ) the model eliminates the need for a pseudoknot recognizing factor the evidence of which has not been forthcoming in either competition assays in in vitro translation systems ( 21 ) or by gel retardation assays ( j d dinman unpublished data ) and ( vi ) elimination of a potential torsion restraining stem 2 but not of a non torsion restraining stem 2 in hiv 1 resulted in decreased 1 prf efficiencies ( 22 ) though all of the cited studies support the torsional restraint model none has directly addressed it in the experiments presented in this study a series of pseudo pseudoknot containing reporter constructs were used to test the torsional restraint hypothesis in vitro frameshifting assays show that frameshifting can be significantly stimulated by limiting the rotational freedom of the loop region of a stem loop structure and that the degree of rotational freedom of stem 1 is important in determining the extent of 1 prf furthermore mrna toeprint analyses reveal a pseudo pseudoknot specific strong stop 16 nt 3 of the slippery site consistent with this structure being able to direct ribosomes to pause with their a and p sites positioned at the slippery site all synthetic dna oligonucleotides were purchased by idt ( coralville ia ) the modified l a viral 1 prf signal containing the g ggu uua slippery site followed by a simple stem loop was amplified from pjd18 ( 23 ) using the primers luc5 b ( 5 ccccaagcttatgacttctaggcagggtttagg 3 ) and luc3 b ( 5 ccccccatgggacgttgtaaaaacgacgggatc 3 ) these were digested with hindiii and ncoi ( restriction sites are underlined ) and cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pt7 luc minus 3 untranslated region a50 ( 24 ) in the resulting reporter construct ( pjd214 18 ) expression of firefly luciferase requires a 1 frameshift and the 5 sequence of the stem 2 is not able to base pair with the 3 sequence so that only a stem loop rather than a pseudoknot is able to form the same primers were used to amplify dna from pjdr ( 23 ) to make pjd214 r in this construct complementary mutations ( 5 gcuggc 3 to 5 cgaccg 3 ) in the 3 acceptor sequence of the pseudoknot forming region of stem 2 allow the formation of an mrna pseudoknot that has previously been shown to promote frameshifting at the same frequency as the wild type ( 23 ) the primer luc5 con ( 5 ccccaagcttatgacttctaggcaagggtttagg 3 ) contains an additional a nucleotide upstream of the slippery site and was used to make pjd214 0 the zero frame control to eliminate the possibility of internal initiation occurring at the luciferase initiation codon downstream of the frameshift signals the aug codon was changed to aua the stratagene quikchange kit was used to mutate pjd214 18 and pjd214 r into pjd336 18 and pjd366 r respectively using the oligonucleotides 5 ggcgttcttctatgggacgttgtaaaaacggatc 3 and 5 gatccgtcgtttttacaacgtcccatagaagacgcc 3 ( the mutated codon is underlined ) pjd366 18 was further mutated to make a zero frame control by placing an a upstream of the slippery site using the oligonucleotides 5 tgacttctaggcaagggtttaggagtg and 5 cactcctaaacccttgcctagaagtca ( the inserted base is underlined ) a series of synthetic dna oligonucleotides were designed to join the loop acceptor

transcribed from pjd366 18 and the 5 regions of these oligos base pair with the downstream sequence this orientation is reversed for the r oligos these general orientations are shown in figure 3b the

proteinase k and sds to a final concentration of 0 5 followed by digestion at 50 c for 30 min volumes were then increased to 100 l extracted twice with phenol / chloroform and dna was precipitated with 10 l nh4ac and 250 l ethanol the purified dna was resuspended in depc treated h2o to prepare synthetic mrnas 2 l of purified linear dnas were used for in vitro transcription using the ambion t7 mmachine mmessage kit rnas were precipitated using 30 l depc h2o and 25 l liac the rna was resuspended in 11 l depc h2o ( 1 l in 500 would give an od260 of 0 05 00 1 1 2 g / l ) to anneal the oligonucleotides with the mrna j oligos r oligos or the equivalent volumes of dilution buffer alone ( 20 mm tris ph 7 4 2 mm mgcl2 and 50 mm edta final concentration ) were added to synthetic mrna ( 0 5 g ) and the mixtures were first incubated in a 70 c heating block for 10 min the block was then removed and allowed to cool to 37 c ( 30 min ) after which they were briefly spun down and incubated on ice in all experiments the molar ratios of j and r oligos to synthetic mrnas were 100 1 in experiments using the competing oligonucleotide ( c oligo ) this was added to either 0 5 1 or 1 1 molar ratios with either j or r oligonucleotides reticulocyte lysates were thawed on ice 15 l of met and 15 l of leu master mixes plus 20 l of h2o were added to 400 l of lysate and 19 l of this was added to each annealed reaction to start the in vitro translation reactions these were incubated at 30 c for 60 min ( the reaction reached a plateau after 30 35 min where the greatest difference was seen between the zero frame controls and the frameshifting plasmids ) ( data not shown ) and the reactions were then placed on ice an aliquot of 7 5 l from each in vitro translation reaction was added to 50 l of the prewarmed luciferase reagent and luminescence readings were taken after a 3 s delay for 15 s in triplicate using a turner 20 / 20 luminometer synthetic transcripts generated from drai digested pjd366 18 ( 1 7 kb ) were 5 end labeled using 32p ctp these rnas ( 4 l ) were incubated with 1 l of annealing buffer and either 1 l of h2o or 1 l of an oligo ( 0 25 ng ) at 70 c the heating block was allowed to cool at room temperature for 40 min before 8 l of rnaseh buffer was added ( 20 mm hepes 50 mm kcl 10 mm mgcl2 and 1 mm dtt ) an aliquot of 1 l of enzyme was added ( mung bean nuclease rnaseh or rnaset1 ) and the reactions incubated at 37 c for 1 h the reactions were stopped by adding 4 l of stop solution the products separated through a 6 polyacrylamide urea denaturing gel and visualized by autoradiography jd366 18 mrna ( 1 g in 8 l ) was annealed with 2 l of 3 end labeled toeprinting primer ( 5 cgtacgtgatcttcacc 3 complementary to sequence 240 bp 3 of the slippery site ) as described above this was added to 15 l of lysate ( 200 l ambion retic lysate 7 5 l of each master mix leu and met and 70 l of 250 mm kcl ) except for 2 l which was added to 15 l of rt buffer 50 mm tris hcl ( 25 ) 40 mm kcl 6 mm mgcl2 5 mm dtt and 575 m dntps to be used as a no ribosome control in vitro translation reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min which was empirically determined to provide the optimum amount of time to allow ribosomes to initiate translation and pause at the frameshift signal subsequently 15 l of rt buffer containing rnasin inhibitor and cycloheximide ( to a final concentration of 100 ng / l ) was added to stop translation to this 2 l of superscript ii ( invitrogen ) was added and the reaction incubated at room temperature for 10 min reactions were terminated by phenol chloroform extraction and 15 l of stop solution added the toeprinting primer was also used in conjunction with pjd366 18 to produce sequencing ladders by standard dideoxynucleotide chain termination methods using sequenase ( usb ) products were separated though 6 polyacrylamide urea denaturing gels and visualized using a storm phosphorimager ( pharmacia ) we previously showed in intact yeast cells that the pseudoknot containing mrna produced from pjdr was able to promote efficient 1 prf whereas one in which only a stem loop can form transcribed from pjd18 could not ( 23 ) as a first step in this study we tested the ability of synthetic mrnas produced from pjd366 r and from pjd366 18 two plasmids derived from these parental constructs to promote 1 prf total luciferase activities produced from these synthetic mrnas were divided by the luciferase activity produced from the zero frame control plasmid pjd366 0 and multiplied by 100 to determine 1 prf efficiencies the results show that the trends observed in yeast were replicated in vitro i e jd366 r mrna promoted 8 efficiency of 1 prf as compared with 1 1 promoted by jd366 18 mrna ( figure 2 ) the torsional restraint model predicts that conditions that would inhibit the rotational freedom of the loop region of the pjd366 18 derived mrna should result in enhanced 1 prf efficiency the strategy used in this study was to anneal this mrna with synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to both the loop region and to the sequence downstream that is normally involved in pseudoknot formation these pseudo pseudoknots would be predicted to restore a pseudoknot like structure to the mrna this is diagrammed in figure 3a two different classes of oligonucleotides having different orientations relative to the mrna were used to this end joining ( j ) and reverse ( r ) oligos the orientation of the j oligos promotes the formation of a structure containing the equivalent of a loop 2 region while that of the r oligos promotes a loop 1 equivalent the model also predicts that pseudo pseudoknots having different degrees of rotational freedom should promote different frequencies of ribosome pausing over the slippery site resulting in different efficiencies of 1 prf in order to control this parameter increasing numbers of nucleotides were inserted between the mrna hybridizing regions of the j and r oligos the additional non complementary bases in the j oligos are 3 to the stem loop residues involved in stem 2 thus effectively increasing loop 2 similarly the additional non complementary bases in the r oligos are 5 to the loop acceptor residues and correspond to an increased loop 1 the structure of the stem loop of pjd366 18 and its maximum base paired interactions with representative j and r oligos are shown in figure 3b to demonstrate that an oligonucleotide mrna hybrid was capable of forming under the assay conditions the j1 oligo was incubated with 5 32p labeled jd366 18 mrna and subjected to rnaseh digestion digestion of the rna dna hybrid resulted in a labeled 110 nt fragment demonstrating that the oligonucleotide bound to the mrna at the position of the pseudoknot ( figure 4 ) having demonstrated the utility of the in vitro frameshifting assay and that the j and r series of oligonucleotides were able to hybridize with synthetic mrna produced from pjd366 18 the next step was to monitor frameshifting efficiencies promoted by these hybrid species significant increases in frameshifting were observed with the incubation of pjd366 18 mrna with oligonucleotides j1 ( 10 ) and j2 ( 35 ) while only modest increases were seen with j3 and j4 ( figure 5 ) these findings are consistent with the notion that changes in the degree of rotational freedom of the structure would affect the distribution of paused ribosomes in the vicinity of the slippery site one potential complication with the j oligos is the possibility that they could interact with the loop 2 stem 1 region in the r oligos the additional bases are distal to any possible loop 2 stem 1 interactions and would be more analogous to increasing loop 1 the r oligos stimulated 1 prf to an even higher extent than the j oligos ( figure 5 ) importantly increasing the length of the bridging regions in these oligonucleotides ( r1 to r3 ) which is predicted to increase the rotational freedom of the stem loop resulted in decreased frameshifting activity as predicted by the torsional resistance model however addition of three residues between the two binding regions of the r oligo ( r4 ) resulted in an unexpected increase in frameshifting with a very large amount of variation in a series of control experiments 8 nt oligos complementary to the 5 ( loop 1 ) and 3 stem 2 forming regions of the pseudo pseudoknot were hybridized to the sl mrna and 1 prf assays were performed neither of these were able to stimulate 1 prf even at concentrations in 100 fold molar excess to the mrna template ( data not shown ) though supportive of our central hypothesis it is also possible that these results were due to the thermodynamic instability of the rna dna duplexes through the course of the experimental protocol to determine whether the stimulation of frameshifting was specifically due to the bridging of the stem loop with downstream sequence ( the pseudo pseudoknot ) as opposed to the nonspecific presence of an rna dna hybrid the competing oligonucleotide ( c oligo ) was designed to form a 15 bp duplex with jd366 18 mrna including the 3 stem 2 forming region which was expected to significantly out compete either the j or r oligos from binding to this site thus disrupting formation of the pseudo pseudoknot ( see figure 3a ) additionally in the presence of the c oligo the j and r oligos were still predicted to hybridize with the 5 stem 2 forming region enabling us to address the question of whether this interaction alone was able to stimulate frameshifting the results demonstrate that the addition of the c oligo severely inhibited the abilities of both the j and r oligos to promote efficient frameshifting ( figure 6 ) these findings demonstrate that ( i ) frameshifting was specifically stimulated by bridging of the 5 and 3 stem 2 forming regions by the j and r oligos and ( ii ) that the presence of an rna dna hybrid at the 5 stem 2 forming region was not sufficient to stimulate frameshifting by itself the torsional restraint model predicts that pseudoknots should direct elongating ribosomes to pause at one specific location on the mrna rather than being distributed along stem 1 we used mrna toeprint assays to test this hypothesis in mrna toeprint reactions the movement of reverse transcriptase is blocked by paused ribosomes resulting in a strong stop positioned 16 18 nt 3 of the p site of eukaryotic ribosomes ( 25 ) synthetic jd366 18 mrnas were annealed with the sequencing oligonucleotide and either j1 r1 or no second oligo and these were then used for in vitro translation reactions after a period of time ( 10 min were empirically determined to be optimal ) elongation reactions were stopped by the addition of cycloheximide and reverse transcription reactions were initiated on the sequencing oligonucleotides in parallel control reverse transcription reactions were carried out using synthetic jd366 18 mrna and oligonucleotides but without in vitro translation the results are consistent with the model showing that the j1 and r1 oligos specifically promoted one strong reverse transcriptase stop 16 nt 3 of the p site of the slippery site only the in the in vitro translation reactions ( figure 7 ) as further predicted by the model a broad distribution of stops of equal intensities was observed in this region with jd366 18 mrna alone ( figure 7 lane 1 ) importantly the + 16 stop was not observed when toeprint reactions were carried in the absence of ribosomes additional strong stops were also of interest one corresponding to the 3 end of the base of stem 1 was observed in all samples consistent with the presence of this structure both j and r oligo specific pauses were also observed the reason for the strong pause in the j oligo is unknown the r oligo specific pause is perhaps more revealing it occurs at the 3 end of the rna dna hybrid formed by this oligo and the mrna a structure that should also promote pausing of reverse transcriptase the results presented in this study provide strong support for the torsional restraint model of programmed 1 frameshifting specifically we demonstrated that rna dna hybrids that mimic mrna pseudoknots can significantly stimulate frameshifting as predicted by the model changing the rotational freedom of the structure by altering the lengths in the j1 and r1 oligos between the 5 and 3 mrna hybridizing regions resulted in changes in their abilities to stimulate 1 frameshifting the demonstration that these pseudo pseudoknot structures cause elongating ribosomes to specifically pause with their a and p sites positioned at the slippery site provides independent evidence in support of the model in the case of the j oligo series frameshifting was best stimulated by j2 suggesting the structure created and the rotational freedom allowed by it was optimal for 1 prf the experimental design is such that we assume a similar rate of unfolding for each oligo as the predicted maximum base pairing is the same for them all however we do note that the type of nucleotides separating the two separately paired regions of the oligos and their presentation may play a role in 1 prf efficiency the recent nmr structural solution of the srv 1 pseudoknot revealed a highly structured loop 2 stem 1 interface including base triples involving an a residue at the 3 end of loop 2 ( 26 ) the additional base in the j2 oligonucleotide is also an a mutagenesis experiments in this region by other groups showed for example that replacing the 3 base in loop 2 of ibv with an a residue promoted a significant increase in frameshifting efficiency ( 27 ) and mutation or removal of the a residue at the 3 base in loop 2 of the bwyv pseudoknot reduced frameshifting levels ( 17 ) this part of the pseudoknot has been proposed to be important in a frameshifting model where differential transition state energy barriers ( due to small differences in local structure stability or dynamics ) are the primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency ( 3 ) indeed a loop 2 stem 1 triplex interaction seen in smaller frameshifting pseudoknots from luteoviruses has been shown to be critical for 1 prf and that similar pseudoknots lacking the triplex are less efficient at frameshifting ( 28 ) and references therein this extra structural feature would limit the rate of unfolding and provide extra anchoring of stem 2 as the ribosome attempts to unwind stem 1 i e it too would help to provide additional torsional restraint it is also possible that although the j3 and j4 oligonucleotides also help to form a pseudo pseudoknot the additional bases may interfere with the stabilization of stem 1 with the r oligos a general correlation was observed between minimization of rotational freedom and frameshifting efficiency though this was not the case of the r4 oligo since the stability of the pseudo pseudoknot generated with r4 should be similar to that of the other oligonucleotides based on the base pairing this result suggests that there are additional considerations to be uncovered with regard to the pseudoknot structure influencing frameshifting addition of residues in the r oligos was analogous to lengthening loop 1 which is typically short in 1 frameshifting pseudoknots limited and conflicting data are available on the importance of loop 1 in 1 frameshifting pseudoknots in one study addition of three a bases to loop 1 did not affect frameshifting efficiency ( 15 ) while in another all the mutations made in this region were detrimental to frameshifting efficiency ( 17 ) given the complex interactions occurring between the helices and loops in this region we cannot yet account for why the r4 oligo stimulated frameshifting so efficiently and with such variable results examination of the rna toeprint data presented here reveals that both of the pseudo pseudoknot structures formed by the j1 and r1 oligos promoted strong stops of the reverse transcriptase 16 nt 3 of the p site codon of the slippery site consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of stem 2 forces ribosomes to pause with their a and p sites positioned over the slippery site previous studies mapping the lagging edge of paused ribosomes i e mrna heelprint studies did not reveal any striking differences between the effects of pseudoknots versus stem loops ( 816 ) interestingly using this method the ribosomal pauses appeared distributed over a broader stretch of mrna ( 4 nt ) than observed here it is possible that some critical level of resolution is lost in the requirement for many additional manipulations of substrates using the mrna heelprint as compared with the toeprint methods a remaining question centers on whether the role of the rna pseudoknot in 1 prf is passive or active in the 9 a solution ( 6 ) the frameshift mechanism is activated by movement of the a site codon anticodon complex by 1 base in the 5 direction upon accommodation as currently described the mrna pseudoknot merely passively blocks entry of the downstream message into the ribosome resulting in stretching of the segment of mrna located between the codon anticodon complex and the pseudoknot by this model all of the energetic input for the frameshift is derived from hydrolysis of gtp by eef1a however it is possible that the pseudoknot may also actively contribute to the frameshift mechanism specifically pulling the downstream message into the ribosome at accommodation could result in unwinding of stem 1 of the pseudoknot by one additional base pair the energetic cost of so doing would be to introduce an equivalent amount of torsional resistance into stem 2 if stem 2 were to release this resistance by pulling back the base pair in stem 1 would be re formed which in turn would contribute to the energy required to dissociate the a and p site codon anticodon complexes from the zero frame this would be followed by slippage of the mrna by 1 base in the 3 direction relative to the ribosome followed by the formation of 1 frame codon anticodon complexes as such the proposed active role for the mrna pseudoknot would further reduce the energetic barrier to 1 prf in sum we suggest that the torsional restraint model can be combined with the 9 a solution to mechanistically explain the original simultaneous slippage model of 1 prf ( 910 ) in other words the 9 a solution + torsional restraint = simultaneous slippage two recent publications have also shown that oligonucleotide mrna duplexes can stimulate efficient 1 ribosomal frameshifting ( 2930 ) these studies differed from the present one in a number of ways particularly insofar as they examined the effects duplex structures immediately 3 of the slippery site rather than addressing mrna pseudoknot related questions the findings support the notion that the specific location of ribosome pausing on the mrna plays a critical role in determining frameshifting though they do come with caveats e g neither study directly mapped ribosomal pausing and the use of different slippery sites and downstream contexts likely contributed to disparate findings for the optimal distances between the 3 ends of slippery sites and 5 ends of frameshift stimulating oligonucleotides although potentially useful therapeutically there are no known natural examples of frameshifting stimulated in this manner and thus these results do not affect the hypothesis presented here however these studies are important in that they raise the possibility for a new role for micro rnas in regulating gene expression and for therapeutic approaches to correcting inborn errors of metabolism due to the presence of frameshift mutations,
snqdma0s,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1072806/,"brock binkowski, kathryn richmond, james kaysen, michael sussman, peter belshaw",correcting errors in synthetic dna through consensus shuffling,,methods for the automated chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides ( 12 ) and their assembly into long double stranded dna ( dsdna ) sequences by pcr ( 34 ) and lcr ( 5 ) have enabled the chemical synthesis of genes and even entire viral genomes ( 67 ) these technological advances have helped spur the formation of the new field of synthetic biology ( 8 ) which aims at defining the functional units of living organisms through the modular engineering of synthetic organisms in addition the demand for fully synthetic gene length dna fragments of defined sequence has dramatically increased in recent years for use in applications such as codon optimization ( 9 ) construction of dna vaccines ( 10 ) de novo synthesis of novel biopolymers ( 11 ) or simply to gain access to known dna sequences when original templates are unavailable the future demand for long synthetic dna is likely to dramatically increase when it becomes cheaper / faster to synthesize a desired sequence than to obtain it by other means the assembly of dna is currently limited by the presence of random sequence errors in synthetic oligonucleotides that arise from side reactions during synthesis ( incomplete couplings misincorporations etc ) and resulting in 1 3 errors / kb ( 71213 ) the deleterious impact of these errors becomes more significant as the desired lengths of synthetic dna increase indeed in the remarkable assembly of the phix 174 bacteriophage genome ( 5386 bp ) using gel purified synthetic oligonucleotides the products contained an average of 2 lethal errors / kb resulting in 1 plaque forming genomes per 20 000 clones ( 7 ) a functional selection ( plaque formation ) was required in this study to identify a clone with the correct sequence thus error reduction / correction is a requirement for the efficient production of long synthetic dna of defined sequence however the process of sequencing multiple clones and manual correction of errors is both costly and time consuming several methods have been reported for the removal of error containing sequences in populations of dna these methods rely upon the selective destruction ( 1415 ) or physical separation ( 1617 ) of mismatch containing heteroduplexes smith and modrich ( 14 ) reported the selective destruction of error containing sequences in pcr products by generating dsdna breaks upon overdigestion with the escherichia coli mismatch specific endonuclease muthls ( 18 ) gel purification and cloning of the remaining full length dna resulted in an apparent 10 fold reduction in the error rate for pcr products however the existing approaches are not well suited for error removal in long synthetic dna sequences where virtually all members in the population contain multiple errors error correction with muts is outlined in figure 1 the population of dna molecules containing random errors is first re hybridized to expose synthesis errors as mismatches ( figure 1a ) duplexes containing mismatches can then be removed from the population by affinity capture with immobilized muts ( figure 1b ) a process we term coincidence filtering since both strands of the duplex must match to pass this filtering step for long synthetic dna sequences or for sequences with high error rates coincidence filtering is ineffective since the likelihood of both strands being perfectly matched after re hybridization is very low to generalize muts error filtering for application on synthetic dna the synthetic dna is cleaved into small overlapping fragments before muts filtering fragments containing mismatches are selectively removed through absorption to an immobilized maltose binding protein ( mbp ) thermus aquaticus ( taq ) muts his6 fusion protein ( mbp muts h6 ) ( 18 20 ) the remaining mixture of fragments ( enriched with fragments of the correct sequence ) serves as a template for assembly pcr to produce the full length product ( figure 1c ) this process can be iterated until the consensus sequence emerges as the dominant species in the population this approach is equivalent to dna shuffling ( 21 ) with additional mismatch exposure and removal steps in this report we assemble gfpuv from synthetic oligonucleotides and apply both coincidence filtering and consensus shuffling protocols to reduce errors in the resultant dna populations the error rates are characterized by gene function ( fluorescence ) and by dna sequencing we also provide a mathematical model describing the error reduction protocols to aid predictions about parameters influencing their effectiveness

concentrated purified and concentrated dna fragments were reassembled as above with aliquots removed at varying cycles aliquots of assembly reactions were resolved on 2 agarose gels to monitor the reassembly process aliquots showing predominantly reassembled full length gfpuv were pcr amplified as above aliquots of supernatant from coincidence filtering experiments were diluted 10 fold and pcr amplified as above pcr products were digested with bamhi / ecori and ligated into the 2595 bp bamhi ecori fragment of pgfpuv ligations were transformed into e coli dh5 and fluorescent colonies were scored using a handheld 365 nm ultraviolet ( uv ) lamp ten non fluorescent gfpuv clones were pooled in equal amounts the nature and location of the mutations in these clones is shown in figure 4 the gfp coding region was pcr amplified from the mixture and submitted to the consensus shuffling protocol with and without the application of the mbp muts h6 error filter to create an error filter we constructed a fusion protein between mbp ( 19 ) and the mismatch binding protein from t aquaticus ( 22 ) with a c terminal his6 tag ( mbp muts h6 ) mbp muts h6 was overexpressed and purified from e coli to > 95 purity ( supplementary figure 1 ) mbp muts h6 immobilized on amylose resin was shown to selectively retain a 40mer heteroduplex containing a deletion mutation over wild type homoduplex ( supplementary figure 2 ) to demonstrate error correction unpurified 40mer oligonucleotides were assembled by pcr ( 3 ) to produce a 760 bp gene encoding green fluorescent protein ( 25 ) ( gfpuv ) two independent preparations of gfpuv containing typical gene synthesis errors ( figure 3 and table 1 ) were re hybridized and subjected to two iterations of coincidence filtering or consensus shuffling for consensus shuffling the gfpuv assembly product was split into three pools and digested into sets of overlapping fragments using distinct type ii restriction enzymes ( figure 2 ) the digests were pooled and subjected to error filtering with or without added mbp muts h6 the unbound fragments were reassembled into full length products and pcr amplified for coincidence filtering unbound full length gfpuv was pcr amplified following treatment with the error filter after cloning in e coli error rates were estimated by scoring colonies for fluorescence under a handheld uv lamp ( figure 3 ) the actual error rates of the input and consensus shuffled populations were determined by sequencing plasmid dna from randomly selected colonies ( figure 3 ) the results show that two rounds of consensus shuffling increased the percentage of fluorescent colonies from 60 to > 90 and reduced the error rate of the populations 4 3 and 3 5 fold from values of 1 3 to 0 3 and 0 98 to 0 28 errors / kb respectively mbp muts h6 was required to increase the fraction of fluorescent colonies in each round of error filtering the nature of the errors in the input and consensus shuffled populations are reported in table 1 although dna shuffling has traditionally been used to create diversity through the combinatorial shuffling of mutations in a population dna shuffling also creates a sub population of sequences with a reduction in diversity as correct fragments can recombine to produce error free sequences indeed with consensus shuffling it is possible to start with a population of dna molecules wherein every individual in the population contains errors and create a new population where the dominant sequence is error free to demonstrate this 10 non fluorescent gfpuv clones each containing a deletion mutation ( figure 4 ) were pooled and subjected to either dna shuffling alone or two iterations of consensus shuffling products were cloned in e coli and the percentage of fluorescent colonies was monitored as an indication of progress toward the consensus sequence dna shuffling alone ( no mbp muts h6 ) increased the percentage of fluorescent colonies to 30 ( 387 colonies total ) similar to a previous report ( 26 ) two rounds of consensus shuffling gave a new population that was 82 fluorescent ( 551 colonies total ) indicating that the dominant species was likely the consensus sequence of the input population both consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering protocols were effective in reducing errors in synthetic gfpuv populations ( figure 3 ) in both cases two iterations of either consensus shuffling or coincidence filtering increased fluorescent colonies from average values of 60 to 90 sequencing data from two independent experiments showed a 4 3 and 3 5 fold reduction in the error rate for the consensus shuffled populations compared with the input populations giving final error rates of 0 3 and 0 28 errors / kb respectively these results demonstrate the usefulness of the mbp muts h6 error filter in both consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering protocols taq muts has previously been shown to bind to deletion mutations with high affinity ( 27 ) a mutation common in synthetic dna however it is important to note that taq muts has lower affinity for specific point mutations and binds weakly to homoduplex dna ( 27 ) these factors may limit the stepwise efficiency of the error filter moreover specific point mutations may be refractory to removal even after multiple rounds of consensus shuffling two rounds of consensus shuffling using the mbp muts h6 error filter proved most effective in reducing deletions and g / c to a / t transitions consistent with previous reports for the selectivity of taq muts ( 27 ) however it must be emphasized that each synthetic oligonucleotide point mutation would generate two heteroduplex dna molecules containing unique mismatches after pcr amplification and re hybridization ( figure 1a and table 1 ) for example a g to a transition mutation in a synthetic oligonucleotide would generate heteroduplexes with g t or a c mismatches after pcr amplification and re hybridization for consensus shuffling either of these mismatch containing heteroduplexes could evade precipitation by the mbp muts h6 error filter and participate in the reassembly of full length gfpuv therefore table 1 lists the pair of mismatches that could give rise to the observed transition or transversion mutation these results show that the mbp muts h6 error filter was most effective at removing insertion / deletion loops and g t / a c mismatches from the population it should be possible to generalize the consensus shuffling protocol to a large number of synthetic dna constructs gfpuv was chosen as the synthetic construct in this study for its advantages as a fluorescent reporter gene this allowed easy optimization of our protocol without the need to sequence thousands of base pairs of dna we expect the results reported here for consensus shuffling to readily translate to synthetic dna constructs of varied sequence greater overall length and / or higher initial errors / kb synthetic dna constructs of varied sequence can be digested into a defined set of fragments using type ii restriction enzymes or fragmented into any desired size range using controlled dnase i digestion ( 26 ) digestion and reassembly of a large number of different genes is expected to be as robust as the protocol of dna shuffling ( 28 ) which has been broadly applied to a variety of gene sequences synthetic dna constructs larger than gfpuv are expected to be amenable to error correction by consensus shuffling as the error filtering is conducted on gene fragments before reassembly of the full length gene thus the errors / kb data presented in this study are expected to translate to larger genes with similar initial errors / kb ( excepting mutations introduced by pcr amplification following the final application of the error filter ) synthetic dna constructs of higher initial errors / kb are expected to be amenable for error correction by consensus shuffling however these constructs will require digestion into smaller sized gene fragments that may affect the efficiency of error correction in contrast to consensus shuffling an increase in the size of the synthetic dna product or an increase in errors / kb would preclude the use of the coincidence filtering protocol as every molecule in the population would contain one or more errors as proof of the utility of the consensus shuffling protocol 10 non fluorescent gfpuv clones containing one or more errors ( figure 4 ) were converted into a population where 82 of the clones were fluorescent it is important to note that dna shuffling alone shows an improvement in percent fluorescent colonies in this example ( from 0 to 30 ) for synthetic dna populations dna shuffling alone shows no improvement in percent fluorescent colonies ( see figure 3 no muts treatments ) dna shuffling alone improves the overall number of correct sequences only for small dna populations with low error rates for example when shuffling 10 clones with a unique mutation in each clone one would expect the fraction of correct products to be ( 9 / 10 ) 10 = 35 ( 26 ) very close to the value of 30 that we observed a mathematical model describing the error rates for shuffling and error filtering of synthetic dna populations is presented below to estimate some parameters of consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering a simple mathematical model ( equations 1 6 ) was constructed an input population of dsdna molecules of length n containing e errors / base is re hybridized fragmented into shorter dsdna fragments of average length s error filtered and reassembled p ( f ) is the probability a fragment of length s will have a correct sequence we determine the probability that re hybridized duplexes will have zero ( c ) one ( h ) or both ( i ) strands with errors equation 5 estimates the probability that a fragment will be correct after a cycle of muts filtering p ( f ) by applying a muts selectivity factor ( m ) to adjust the relative amounts of mismatch containing duplexes ( i h ) while accounting for the total fraction of correct strands in the re hybridized duplexes the probability of obtaining an error free assembly product p ( a ) is then given by equation 6 1p ( f ) = ( 1 e ) s 2c = p ( f ) 2 3i = 1 p ( f ) 2 4h = 1 i c 5p ( f ) = 2c + hm2c + 2hm + 2im 6p ( a ) = p ( f ) ns from our consensus shuffling error rate data ( figure 3 ) we estimate the muts selectivity factor m to be 2 2 figure 5 shows some predictions that emerge from this model assuming typical length ( 2 kb ) fragment sizes ( 200 bp ) and error rates ( 1 8 errors / kb ) consensus shuffling is predicted to be most effective with smaller fragment sizes ( figure 5a ) as mentioned above smaller fragment sizes could be obtained by controlled digestion with dnase i ( 21 ) in addition multiple iterations of muts filtering can have dramatic results on populations with few correct sequences ( figure 5b ) although the model does not account for the differing specificity of muts toward the various types of mismatches the model also predicts that even modest improvements in the muts selectivity factor through optimization of the muts dna binding conditions and / or the use of a combination of muts homologs with varying mismatch specificity ( 29 ) could dramatically improve the consensus shuffling protocol ( figure 5c ) coincidence filtering ( n = s ) is predicted to be effective for populations with low error rates per clone ( figure 5d ) but becomes ineffective when the majority of re hybridized duplexes contain mismatches we have demonstrated consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering as experimental methods to significantly reduce errors in synthetic dna consensus shuffling should be generally applicable for error correction on synthetic genes of typical lengths and error rates two iterations of consensus shuffling ( 6 h / iteration ) generated a population with 1 error / 3500 bp this reduction in error rate will allow the identification of a correct clone after sequencing dna from a reduced number of colonies coincidence filtering is a simple and effective procedure to reduce errors in synthetic dna populations with low error rates per clone these methods should significantly increase the speed and decrease the cost of production of synthetic genes note while this manuscript was under review carr et al ( 30 )

charles auffray",towards standardization of rna quality assessment using user independent classifiers of microcapillary electrophoresis traces,,purity and integrity of rna are critical elements for the overall success of rna based analyses including gene expression profiling methods to assess the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single assay starting with low quality rna may strongly compromise the results of downstream applications which are often labor intensive time consuming and highly expensive however in spite of the need for standardization of rna sample quality control presently there is no real consensus on the best classification criteria conventional methods are often not sensitive enough not specific for single stranded rna and susceptible to interferences from contaminants present in the sample for instance when using a spectrophotometer a ratio of absorbances at 260 and 280 nm ( a260 a280 ) greater than 1 8 is usually considered an acceptable indicator of rna purity ( 12 ) however the a260 measurement can be compromised by the presence of genomic dna leading to over estimation of the actual rna concentration on the other hand the a280 measurement will estimate the presence of protein but provide no hint on possible residual organic contaminants considered at 230 nm ( 3 5 ) pure rna will have a260 a230 equal to a260 a280 and > 1 8 ( 1 ) a second check involves electrophoresis analysis routinely performed using agarose gel electrophoresis with rna either stained with ethidium bromide ( etbr ) ( 6 9 ) or the more sensitive sybr green dye ( 10 ) the proportion of the ribosomal bands ( 28s 18s ) has conventionally been viewed as the primary indicator of rna integrity with a ratio of 2 0 considered to be typical of high quality intact rna ( 1 ) however these methods are highly sample consuming using 0 5 2 g total rna and often not sensitive enough to detect slight rna degradation today microfluidic capillary electrophoresis with the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies usa ) has become widely used particularly in the gene expression profiling platforms ( 1112 ) it requires only a very small amount of rna sample ( as low as 200 pg ) the use of a size standard during electrophoresis allows the estimation of sizes of rna bands and the measurement appears relatively unaffected by contaminants integrity of the rna may be assessed by visualization of the 28s and 18s ribosomal rna bands ( figure 1a and b ) an elevated threshold baseline and a decreased 28s 18s ratio both are indicative of degradation a broad band shows dna contamination ( figure 1c ) as it is apparent from a review of the literature the standard of a 2 0 rrna ratio is difficult to meet especially for rna derived from clinical samples and it now appears that the relationship between the rrna profile and mrna integrity is somewhat unclear ( 13 23 ) on the one hand this may reflect unspecific damage to the rna including sample mishandling postmortem degradation massive apoptosis or necrosis but it can reflect specific regulatory processes or external factors within the living cells altogether it appears that total rna with lower rrna ratios is not necessarily of poor quality especially if no degradation products can be observed in the electrophoretic trace ( figure 1d ) for all these reasons the development of a reliable fully integrated and automated system appropriate for numeric evaluation of rna integrity is highly desirable standardized rna quality assessment would allow a more reliable comparison of experiments and facilitate exchange of biological information within the scientific community with that prospect in mind and with the aim of anticipating future standards by pre normative research we identified and tested two software packages recently developed to gauge the integrity of rna samples with a user independent strategy one open source the degradometer software for calculation of the degradation factor and true 28s 18s ratio based on peak heights ( 24 ) and the freely available rin algorithm of the agilent 2100 expert software based on computation of a rna integrity number ( rin ) ( 25 ) both tools were developed separately to extract information about rna integrity from microcapillary electrophoretic traces and produce a user independent metrics using these tools we assessed the purity and integrity of 414 rna samples derived from 14 different human adult tissues and cell lines many of which representing tumors those results were compared with conventional rna quality measurement approaches as well as with highly expert human interpretation we evaluated the simplicity for users and examined the potential accuracy and efficiency of each method to contribute to standardization of rna integrity assessment upstream of biological assays these procedures were further validated by real time rt pcr quantitation of the expression levels of three housekeeping genes using the same rna samples at different levels of degradation total rna was prepared from human cell lines ( especially from the atcc bio resource center n = 50 ) and tissue samples ( clinical samples n = 285 ) from 13 different human adult tissue types i e blood brain breast colon epithelium kidney lymphoma lung liver muscle prostate rectum and thyroid rna purification was performed by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation according to chomczynski and sacchi ( 26 ) by phenol based extraction methods ( trizol reagent invitrogen usa ) or silica gel based purification methods ( rneasy mini kit qiagen germany strataprep kit stratagene usa or sv rna isolation kit promega usa ) according to the manufacturers instructions with some modifications material was maintained at 80 c with minimal handling rna extraction was carried out in an rnase free environment ( see supplementary table 1 online ) the commercially available rna samples were the universal human reference ( n = 75 ) distributed by stratagene ( usa ) and human brain ( n = 2 ) and muscle ( n = 2 ) rnas supplied by clontech ( usa ) once extracted rna concentration and purity was first verified by uv measurement using the ultrospec3100 pro ( amersham biosciences usa ) and 5 mm cuvettes the absorbance ( a ) spectra were measured from 200 to 340 nm a230 a260 and a280 were determined a260 a280 and a260 a230 ratios were calculated for microcapillary electrophoresis measurements the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies usa ) was used in conjunction with the rna 6000 nano and the rna 6000 pico labchip kits in total 39 assays were run in accordance with the manufacturers instructions ( see supplementary notes online ) to evaluate the reliability of the classifier systems described in this study replicate runs were done on a set of 56 rna samples loaded on different chips resulting in 2 ( n = 41 ) 3 ( n = 12 ) 7 ( n = 2 ) and 50 ( n = 1 ) data points per sample rna integrity checking was performed by expert operators who classified each total rna sample within a predefined discrete category from 1 to 5 examining the integrity of the rna from electropherograms ( see supplementary table 2 online ) a low number indicates high integrity reference criteria parameters include ribosomal peaks definition baseline flatness existence of additional or noise peaks between ribosomal peaks low molecular weight species contamination and genomic dna presence suspicion a smearing of either 28s and 18s peaks or a decrease in their intensity ratio indicate degradation of the rna sample and results in the classification into the higher categories to evaluate the robustness of this human interpretation five highly experienced operators trained in these cataloging steps separately classified a subset of 33 samples from breast cancers it included samples with varying levels of integrity intact rna ( 33 ) low quality samples ( 20 ) and a wide range of degradation ( 47 ) bioanalyzer electrophoretic data were exported in the degradometer software folder ( cld format ) for comparison of samples the original data were re scaled by the classifier system first along the time axis to compensate for differences in migration time then along the fluorescence intensity axis to compensate for variation in total rna amount as a result fluorescence curves that have the same shape will have the same peak heights after re scaling then degradation factors ( degfact ) and corrected 28s 18s ratios were calculated ( see supplementary table 3 online ) using the mathematical model developed by auer et al ( 24 ) examining additional degradation peak signals appearing in the lower molecular weight range and comparing them to ribosomal peak heights calculation of the degfact is based on a numbering of continuous metrics ranging from 1 to increasing degfact values correspond to more degradation and a new group of integrity is defined after 8 graduation steps once the classification of the rna samples is completed 4 groups of integrity are displayed 3 showing an alert warning indicative of some measurable degradation ( yellow 8 16 orange 16 24 and red 24 ) while all non reliable data come together and form the fourth group ( black ) we introduced a fifth class labeled white ( < 8 ) when no alert was produced by the software software and manual are freely available at degradometer version 1 4 1 ( released in may 2004 ) of the software was used bioanalyzer electrophoretic sizing files ( cld format ) collected with biosizing software version a 02 12 si292 ( released in march 2003 ) were imported in the agilent 2100 expert software ( rin beta release ) the rin algorithm allows calculation of rna integrity using a trained artificial neural network based on the determination of the most informative features that can be extracted from the electrophoretic traces out of 100 features identified through signal analysis the selected features which collectively catch the most information about the integrity levels include the total rna ratio ( ratio of area of ribosomal bands to total area of the electropherogram ) the height of the 18s peak the fast area ratio ( ratio of the area in the fast region to the total area of the electropherogram ) and the height of the lower marker a total of 1300 electropherograms of rna samples from various tissues of three mammalian species ( human mouse and rat ) showing varying levels of degradation and an adaptive learning approach were used in order to assign a weight factor to the relevant features that describe the rna integrity a rin number is computed for each rna profile ( see supplementary table 4 online ) resulting in the classification of rna samples in 10 numerically predefined categories of integrity the output rin is a decimal or integer number in the range of 1 10 a rin of 1 is returned for a completely degraded rna samples whereas a rin of 10 is achieved for intact rna sample in some cases the measured electropherogram signals are of an unusual shape showing for example peaks at unexpected migration times spikes or abnormal fluctuation of the baseline in such cases a reliable rin computation is not possible several separate neural networks were trained to recognize such anomalies and display a warning to the user or even suppress the display of a rin number combining the results of the neural network for the rin computation and the neural networks to detect anomalies the rin algorithm achieves a mean square error of 0 1 and a mean absolute error of 0 25 on an independent test set the beta release of the software and manual are freely available at agilent 2100 expert version b 01 03 si144 ( released in november 2003 ) of the software was used expression levels of three housekeeping genes ( hkg ) gapd gusb and tfrc were measured by quantitative pcr using the taqman gene expression assays according to the manufacturers instructions ( applied biosystems usa ) sixteen aliquots of a unique batch of rna sample ( universal human reference rna stratagene usa ) of various levels of integrity ( cf table 1 ) were used to test the influence of rna quality on the relative expression of those three genes in parallel a 5 to 3 comparison was done using two separate gusb and tfrc taqman probes an homogeneous quantity ( 0 8 1 g ) of the rna samples was subjected to a reverse transcription step using the high capacity cdna archive kit ( applied biosystems usa ) as described by the manufacturer single stranded cdna products were then analyzed by real time pcr using the taqman gene expression assays according to the manufacturers instructions ( applied biosystems usa ) single stranded cdna products were analyzed using the abi prism 7700 sequence detector ( applied biosystems usa ) the efficiency and reproducibility of the reverse transcription were tested using 18s rrna taqman probes five assays were used gapdh 5 ( hs99999905 m1 ) gusb 5 ( hs00388632 gh ) gusb 3 ( hs99999908 m1 ) tfrc 5 ( hs00951086 m1 ) and tfrc 3 ( hs00951085 m1 ) in each case duplicate threshold cycle ( ct ) values were obtained and averaged then expression levels were evaluated by a relative quantification method ( 27 ) the fold change in one tested hkg ( target gene ) was normalized to the 18s rrna ( reference gene ) and compared to the highest quality sample ( calibrator sample ) using the following formula fold change = 2 ct where ct = ( ct target ct reference ) sample n ( ct target ct reference ) calibrator sample sample n corresponds to any sample for the target gene normalized to the reference gene and calibrator sample represents the expression level ( 1 ) of the target gene normalized to the reference gene considering the highest quality sample mean 2 ct and sd were calculated considering the samples either individually or grouped by quality metrics categories based on rin metrics or degfact values together with the lower and upper bound mean of 95 intervals of confidence ( ic ) using this analysis if the expression levels of the hkg are not affected by the rna degradation the values of the mean fold change at each condition should be very close to 1 ( since 20 = 1 ) ( 27 ) descriptive statistics were executed using the xlstat software version 7 1 ( addinsoft usa ) p = 0 05 mean sd and coefficient of variation ( variation or cv ) between and within groups of samples were calculated together with a measure of the dispersion ( range ) inter quartile range ( 1st and 3rd quartiles q1 q3 ) and evaluation of the lower and upper bound mean of 95 interval of confidence ( ic ) comparative statistical analyses between groups were completed p = 0 05 using non parametric statistical tests two independent mann whitney u test and k independent kruskal wallis test following extraction rna purity was directly determined by uv measurement from the a260 a280 and a260 a230 ratios we found an average a260 a280 ratio of 1 89 interval of confidence ( ic ) 1 88 1 90 with 92 of the values falling within the theoretically expected range ( 1 8 2 1 ) ( figure 2a ) and an average a260 a230 ratio of 1 99 ( ic 1 92 2 06 ) with 73 of the values greater than 1 8 ( see supplementary table 1 online for details ) significant differences in a260 a280 ratios were observed between specific groups of samples ( i e tumoral versus normal or tissues versus cell lines ) for instance rna extracted from normal samples displayed an improved ratio of 1 97 with 97 falling within the desired range ( figure 2a ) in contrast the distribution of a260 a280 ratios was not found to correlate with either purification methods or tissues of origin rna integrity was further assessed by resolving the 28s and 18s ribosomal rna bands using the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and the rna 6000 protocol the analysis was done on 399 rna profiles data from 15 samples was not obtained due to device problems during the runs the system automatically provided 28s 18s ratios for 348 ( 87 ) of the 399 profiles figure 2b shows the distribution of the 28s 18s computed values with a median ratio around 1 7 and a variation of 54 from the mean ( ic 1 9 2 1 and q1 q3 1 4 2 5 ) in addition a significant degree of variability of the 28s 18s ratio ( 19 24 ) was found for identical samples from replicate runs ( 2 50 times ) among those rna samples 28s 18s ratios of 2 0 or greater were rare less than 44 of the values measured being within the theoretically desired range except for the samples prepared from cultured cells ( figure 2b ) the integration failed in the remaining 51 cases displaying an atypical migration with no clear 28s and 18s rrna bands and no 28s 18s ratio was computed ( data not shown ) expert operators categorized the set of rna samples by inspecting the electrophoretic traces of successful assays over the 399 rna profiles checked 379 ( 95 ) were scored within predefined categories ( figure 2c ) namely good human categorization ( hc ) level 1 regular ( hc level 2 ) moderate ( hc level 3 ) low ( hc level 4 ) and degraded ( hc level 5 ) the remaining 20 ( 5 ) were flagged as displaying a temperature sensitive profile rna samples initially found intact became highly degraded when heated although no rnase contamination was observed ( data not shown ) estimation of the robustness of this cataloging was done through comparison of qualifying criteria using a set of 33 breast cancer samples ( see materials and methods ) integrity of the samples was evaluated independently by five expert operators and categorization was found highly reliable with a coefficient variation ( cv ) 16 this is low considering that individual interpretation is involved but can be explained by the fact that very experienced operators accomplished the scoring based on a clearly defined set of instructions thus limiting frequently observed subjective visual interpretation and inconsistency of human categorization predictably a 28s 18s ratio of 2 0 denoted high quality for a majority of rna samples 91 being classified in hc levels 1 to 3 however 83 of total rnas with 28s 18s 1 0 but a low baseline between the 18s and 5s rrna or front marker were also classified in hc levels 1 3 ( see figure 1d ) and could be considered suitable for most downstream applications rna degradation was first assessed using the degradometer software ( see materials and methods ) over the 399 rna profiles checked all were scored in one of the five predefined classes ( figure 3a ) altogether 334 ( 84 ) degradation factors ( degfact ) values were computed the remaining 65 rna samples ( 16 ) displaying profiles that could not be interpreted reliably no degfact values could be scored and samples were flagged in the black category ( figure 3a ) most of them ( 80 ) correspond to samples previously classified by our operators as degraded ( hc level 5 ) the remaining cases had an average degradation factor of 7 5 ( ic 6 7 8 3 ) with large variations over the entire set of samples ( over 103 from the mean range 1 52 ) a lower variability was persistently found when identical samples from replicate runs were considered resulting in observed degfact values with a 26 32 cv in addition statistically significant differences were found between degfact values of samples sorted by types the highest degfact values were found characteristic of tissue samples 41 of them displaying a degfact > 8 as compared with 6 for the cell lines ( data not shown ) remarkably we found a significant linear relationship between the degfact values distribution and the explicit human categorization most hc classes corresponded to an unambiguous degfact distribution ( figure 3b ) while hc levels 2 and 3 form a single class hc level 1 mean degfact of 3 3 sd of 2 8 ( ic 2 8 3 7 ) hc level 2 and 3 mean degfact of 8 8 sd of 6 8 ( ic 7 5 10 2 ) hc level 4 mean degfact of 15 9 sd of 7 8 ( ic 12 7 19 1 ) hc level 5 mean degfact of 26 0 sd of 7 5 ( ic 21 9 30 1 ) it is worth mentioning that the normalized heights of 18s and 28s peaks and the interval between them after rescaling gradually decrease and then reverse with increasing degradation ( figure 3b ) integrity of rna samples was measured in parallel based on the rna integrity number metrics using an artificial neural network trained to distinguish between different rna integrity levels by examining the shape of the microcapillary electrophoretic traces ( see materials and methods ) over the 399 rna profiles checked 363 ( 91 ) were scored successfully ( figure 4a ) with an average rin of 7 7 ( ic 7 4 8 0 ) the remaining 36 ( 9 ) samples were associated with various unexpected signals disturbing computation of the rin using default anomaly detection parameters in each case a flag alert was added corresponding to critical anomalies including unexpected data in sample type ( or ) ribosomal ratio ( or ) baseline and signal in the 5s region ( data not shown ) rin categorization was found regular variability between replicate runs compared to the other methods being consistently very small ( cv 8 12 ) as expected the highest rin were characteristic of cell line samples 72 of them displaying a rin 9 as compared with 47 for the tissue samples ( data not shown ) a first group corresponding to 295 ( 82 ) of the 363 rna profiles was analyzed using the default settings of the rin system but with a lower threshold of rna quantity loaded ( 20 ng ) for reliable detection of anomalies than that recommended by the manufacturer ( 50 ng ) a significant linear relationship was found between the rin number and both the explicit human classification provided by our operators and the degfact values calculated by the degradometer software ( figure 4b ) each distinct hc class corresponds to an explicit rin number with hc levels 2 and 3 forming once again a single class hc level 1 mean rin of 9 6 sd of 0 7 ( ic 9 5 9 7 ) hc level 2 and 3 mean rin of 8 6 sd of 0 9 ( ic 8 4 8 9 ) hc level 4 mean rin of 6 1 sd of 1 5 ( ic 5 2 7 1 ) hc level 5 mean rin of 3 7 sd of 2 0 ( ic 2 9 4 5 ) for the remaining 68 samples ( assay done with < 20 ng of rna ) two separate groups were considered 41 samples with a computed rin below 5 0 and 27 above 7 0 all samples in the first group were derived from rna 6000 nano assays with mean rna quantities loaded below 10 ng ( q1 q3 5 12 ng ) i e below the lower limit of quantitation indicated by the manufacturer all but 8 of these samples were estimated by our operators to be of poor quality ( hc level 4 n = 3 ) or degraded ( hc level 5 n = 30 ) and all but 4 were flagged black by the degradometer software and no degfact values were scored these rna profiles could not be interpreted reliably possibly due to either the low rna concentration or the unusual migration behavior and shifted baseline values of degraded samples thus the two automated systems were in disagreement for these samples while human interpretation was in most cases in agreement with the rin system with less than 20 of inconsistency in the second group of 27 samples 20 of the profiles were derived from rna 6000 pico assays with rna quantities loaded being on average below 4 ng ( q1 q3 0 5 0 8 ng ) which is within the manufacturer specifications all but 3 of them were estimated by our operators to range from high ( hc level 1 n = 12 ) to correct ( hc level 2 and 3 n = 12 ) quality levels in addition all rna profiles except 1 were scored by the degradometer software most of them displaying an alert flag ( n = 20 ) some slight degradation was detected associated to a low mean degfact value of 9 7 ( ic 8 1 11 3 q1 q3 6 2 12 6 ) thus both automated systems and human interpretations agreed in most of these cases with < 11 of inconsistency the influence of rna quality categorization obtained with both user independent classifiers on gene expression profiling was explored using real time rt pcr the expression levels of three housekeeping genes ( hkg ) gapdh gusb and tfrc were measured in 16 aliquots of a unique rna displaying various integrity metrics ( table 1 ) the mean correlation coefficient ( r ) between the threshold cycle ( ct ) among the 16 samples and both quality metrics was found high r = 0 87 considering the rin metrics and r = 0 85 considering the degfact values the values of the mean fold changes calculated according to the 2 ct quantification method ( see materials and methods ) were found lower than 1 0 corresponding to the expression level ( 1 ) in the sample exhibiting the highest rna quality ( table 2 and figure 5 ) considering that hkg expression was measured relative to the reference sample an obvious decline of the relative expression levels was observed up to 24 70 and 82 in samples categorized according to the rin metrics ( figure 5a ) and degfact values ( figure 5b ) these results indicate that 2 to 7 fold differences may be expected in the relative expression levels of genes in samples that differ only by their quality ( table 2 ) these fold differences are much larger than those measured for rna samples of comparable integrity consistently lower than 1 6 ( table 2 and figure 5 ) in addition an unambiguous gap in the distribution may be defined ( figure 5a and b ) distinguishing the rna samples of the higher quality categories ( rin 8 and degfact values < 7 ) from those of the lower categories ( rin < 8 and degfact values 12 ) it would be expected that measuring expression of an intact mrna would yield approximately equal results regardless of the region being probed and if mrna fragmentation had occurred then some sequences may be more abundant than others we thus tested the effect of pcr probe location on the rnas the 5 and 3 gusb probes separated by 1209 nt were associated with highly similar threshold cycle ( ct ) measures ( r = 0 98 parameter = 0 88 ) ( figure 5c ) similar results were obtained for tfrc with probes separated by 2066 nt ( r = 0 84 parameter = 0 92 data not shown ) it seems therefore that the region being probed is not a source of variation in our results it is universally accepted that rna purity and integrity are of foremost importance to ensure reliability and reproducibility of downstream applications in the biomedical literature ( pubmed november 2004 ) from the 485 090 articles that relate to rna and the 287 515 or 40 395 including respectively the quality or integrity term less than 100 were found to contain rna quality or rna integrity terms interestingly half of them were published between 2001 and 2004 but none is proposing a standard operational procedure for rna quality assessment to the scientific community except for two studies ( 2425 ) those reports are based on 10 to 15 years old methods ( 1 ) indicating that they represent the established and currently mostly used methods our results strongly challenge the reliability and usefulness of those conventional methods demonstrating their inconsistency to evaluate rna quality first the a260 a280 and a260 a230 ratios are reflecting rna purity but are not informative regarding the integrity of the rna available rna extraction and purification methods yield highly pure rna with very little dna or other contaminations resulting most often in both ratios 1 8 although 18 of the samples were found degraded and 7 more of poor quality the high a260 a280 ratios are indicative of limited protein contaminations whereas high a260 a230 ratios are indicative of an absence of residual contamination by organic compounds such as phenol sugar or alcohol which could be highly detrimental to downstream applications nonetheless samples displaying low a260 a230 ratios ( 1 8 ) did not exhibit any inhibition during downstream applications such as cdna synthesis and labeling or in vitro transcription ( data not shown ) second due to a lack of reliability the 28s 18s rrna ratios may not be used as a gold standard for assessing rna integrity when ribosomal ratios were calculated from identical samples but through independent runs a large degree of variability ( cv 19 24 ) was observed moreover using the biosizing software we found 28s 18s rrna ratios evaluation compromised by the fact that their calculation is based on area measurements and therefore heavily dependent on definition of start and end points of peaks in 13 of the cases the system was unable to localize the ribosomal peaks and therefore no 28s 18s ratios were computed for the remaining samples no clear correlation between 28s 18s ratios and rna integrity was found although rnas with 28s 18s > 2 0 were usually of high quality most of the rnas we studied ( 83 ) displaying a 28s 18s > 1 0 could be considered of good quality interestingly auer et al ( 24 ) in a study on 19 tissues from seven organisms reported that an objective measurement of the rna integrity may possibly be done through comparison of re scaled 28s and 18s peak heights but not of the corresponding areas actually we observed a linear relationship between rna integrity and differences in normalized 28s and 18s peak heights increased degradation resulted in a significant decrease in the scaled corrected heights of the ribosomal peaks with inversion of the ratio at the highly degraded stages ( cf figure 3b ) in comparison to the area computation 28s 18s rrna re scaled peak height measurement produced more consistent values with a cv reduced to 12 14 and displayed clear concentration independent values ( see supplementary tables 1 and 3 online ) human evaluation of the integrity of rna through visual inspection of the electrophoresis profiles provided very consistent data variability between classifications produced by five independent expert operators ( cv 16 ) was lower than with automated management of more conventional control 28s 18s area values ( cv 19 24 ) it is however very time consuming and strongly dependent on individual competence even with highly trained specialists 5 of the set of rna samples could not be allocated to any of the five predefined categories their corresponding profiles were considered by our experts as atypical displaying a temperature sensitive shape ( data not shown ) these strategies appear unsuitable for standardization and quality control of rna integrity assessment which require simple but consistent expert independent classification facilitating information exchanges between laboratories we therefore investigated the performance of two recently developed user independent software algorithms ( 2425 ) the degradometer software provided a reliable evaluation of rna integrity based on the identification of additional degradation peak signals and their integration in a mathematical calculation together with the ribosomal peak heights it allowed characterization of the integrity of 84 of the samples tested one third with an alert flag which was first found to be fairly informative as it strongly reduces the complexity of the metrics by introducing three distinct classes labeled yellow orange and red and can be used as a first straightforward simple filtering step however degradation factors ( degfact ) metrics yield precise measures with less than 32 cv and are much more valuable than flag alerts for the purpose of standardization the same is true for the rna integrity number rin software which allowed the characterization of the integrity of 91 of the rna samples tested with a rin value for 363 rna sample profiles with less than 12 cv in general there was a good agreement between the human classification the degradation factor and the rin ( see figure 4b ) this provided a cross validation of the user independent qualification systems tested both resulted in the refinement of human interpretations validating four statistically relevant classes of samples namely good ( hc level 1 ) regular / moderate ( hc level 2 and 3 ) poor ( hc level 4 ) and degraded ( hc level 5 ) moreover the 5 rna samples previously flagged by the operators as displaying an atypical temperature sensitive shape were unambiguously assigned to one or the other category of samples rin = 7 3 ( ic 6 8 7 8 ) degfact = 11 9 ( ic 9 5 14 2 ) data not shown altogether we found the degradometer and rin algorithms to be highly reliable user independent methods for automated assessment of rna degradation and integrity the rin system is a slightly more informative tool able to compute assessment metrics for 91 of the rna profiles compared to 84 with the degradometer software the remaining being flagged respectively as n / a or black alert for samples available below a low limit of 20 ng ( n = 80 ) the rin system provided metric values for 85 of them compared to only 46 with the degradometer software similarly the rin system was able to provide metric values for 81 of poor quality samples ( including low quality and degraded samples n = 96 ) whereas the degradometer software could classify only 44 of them another advantage with the rin classifier is that if there are critical anomalies detected ( including genomic dna contamination wavy baseline etc ) threshold settings may be changed and a reliable rin value computed this was the case for 25 of the 363 rna sample profiles successfully classified by the system while intact rna obviously constitutes the best representation of the natural state of the transcriptome there are situations in which gene expression analysis may be desirable even on partially degraded rna some studies report collection of reasonable microarray data from rna samples of impaired quality ( 28 ) leading to meaningful results if used carefully moreover auer et al ( 24 ) recently concluded that degradation does not preclude microarray analysis if comparison is done using samples of comparable rna integrity we confirmed the direct influence of the rna quality on the distribution of gene expression levels by detecting using q pcr a significant ( up to 7 fold ) difference in the relative expression of genes in samples of slightly decreased rna integrity which is much larger than the variation within comparable rna quality categories ( cf figure 5 and table 2 ) this may correlate with ratio discrepancies in gene expression experiments and therefore with false positive and false negative rates of differential gene expression when comparing two samples therefore computing reliable metrics of rna integrity even if the rna is found to be partially degraded may be highly valuable the straight and unambiguous relationships established between human interpretations and both rin and degfact distributions indicates that using these metrics it should be possible to distinguish specific samples that are too disparate to be included in comparative gene expression analyses without compromising the results although the information provided by these user independent classifiers is not a guarantee for successful downstream experiments it gives a more comprehensive picture of the samples and can be used as a safeguard against performing useless and costly experiments thus the rin system may be used as simple metrics that can be easily integrated in any sample tracking information system for definition of standard operating procedures under quality assurance following a scheme such as the one described in figure 6 in this context we suggest that the growing number of laboratories performing rna quality control by microcapillary electrophoresis should be offered the option to report objective rna quality metrics as part of the minimum information about a microarray experiment miame standards ( 29 ) through registration of rna profiles in a public electronic repository such standardized information should enable and facilitate comparisons of rna based bioassays performed across laboratories with rna samples of similar quality in much the same way as sequencing traces are compared supplementary material is

hayashi",species independent detection of rna virus by representational difference analysis using non ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription,,identifying the causative agent of an infectious disease is the cornerstone for its eventual control for example the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) was controlled after the identification of the causative agent coronavirus ( sars cov ) ( 1 ) developments in molecular biological approaches in recent years have led to the identification of many unknown pathogens once a fragment from the agents genome has been isolated and sequenced standard genomic walking techniques are used to extend the known sequence and computer homology searches can then be used to identify the likely phylogenetic relationship of the agent with other known organisms ( 2 ) additionally sequences of some viruses such as sars cov have altered during transmission and this may prevent the detection of the virus by a pcr method ( 34 ) thus a detection method that is not based on the known sequence is essentially required as an alternative method to the normal pcr method representational difference analysis ( rda ) is one of the most reliable methods for identifying new agents since it does not require prior knowledge of the agents class ( 5 ) the technique is based on pcr enrichment of dna fragments that are present in agent infected cells but absent in normal cells using rda chang et al ( 6 ) isolated two dna fragments from a kaposis sarcoma ( ks ) lesion in an aids patient the determination of sequences of these fragments resulted in the discovery of the ks associated herpes virus ( 7 ) despite the fact that rda has been developed for detecting agents with a dna based genome it can be used to detect the presence or absence of rna in a sample by generating a cdna intermediate ( cdna rda ) to amplify the rna ( 8 ) since a large quantity of ribosomal rnas interfere with cdna rda the cdna intermediate should be synthesized from poly ( a ) + rna therefore it is difficult to detect rna viruses from virus infected cells by cdna rda because many viruses have no poly ( a ) at the end of the genome if cdna rda can be applied to total rna without interference with ribosomal rnas the virus genome can be amplified from total rna of virus infected cells by cdna rda the selection of poly ( a ) + rna by using an oligo ( dt ) column followed by oligo ( dt ) priming can eliminate the influence of ribosomal rnas on cdna synthesis primers that are specific to a viral genome also efficiently eliminate the influence of ribosomal rnas however prior knowledge of the virus genome is required for the construction of specific primers in this study based on the fact that cdna can be primed with a mixture of oligomers we constructed a set of oligomers that was inefficient for priming ribosomal rnas but that normally primed most of the genome of an rna virus ( 910 ) based on the frequency distribution of hexanucleotides in ribosomal rnas and viral sequences in current public databases we determined a mixture of 96 hexanucleotides that rarely prime ribosomal rnas but can prime all the known mammalian viruses listed in public databases the results of this study show that species independent detection of viral rna from infected cells is possible a rat primary transcript including 18s 5 8s and 28s ribosomal rna ( v01270 1 ) was selected for hexanucleotide frequency analysis of ribosomal rnas genomic sequences of sars cov ( ay291315 ) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 ( bpi3 nc 002161 ) were also selected as representatives of rna virus ( 11 ) we created three programs greg gas and osc ( produced by cs labs sapporo japan and licensed by sigma aldrich co ltd st louis mo ) connected to a mysql database server ( version 4 0 20 ) the program greg transformed fasta formatted sequence to a text formatted sequence and inserted it into a table in the mysql database ( greg table ) using these programs we designed a mixture of hexanucleotide primers first sequences were divided into hexamers and each hexamer was classified into a pattern of hexanucleotide sequence in which 46 = 4096 patterns were included the program gas generated frequency distributions of hexanucleotides in the sequences in the greg table extracted the progeny with their probabilities of hexanucleotide patterns and inserted them into a table ( gas table ) of the database we made four sets of greg and gas tables for rat ribosomal rnas a satellite repeat bpi3 and sars cov ( table 1 ) the program osc listed the differences between the two gas tables i e the program selected oligomer patterns that exist in bpi3 but not in ribosomal rnas the frequency of hexamer patterns in each rna sequence was transferred into a table of microsoft access a total of 96 hexamer patterns including those having very low frequencies or those that did not appear in ribosomal rnas were synthesized and mixed for use as an rt primer ( table 2 non ribosomal hexanucleotides ) to estimate the frequencies of priming sites with the selected hexanucleotides we prepared a mysql table that included sequence data of reported viral genomes as follows first we downloaded all viral sequences from the ftp site of embl database ( release date 30 june 2004 ) and entered them into tables ( embl data table ) of the mysql database the table included embl id title annotation and sequence as fields the annotation field included taxonomic classification of the origin of the data we separated the words included in the annotation field into taxonomic words such as family names and inserted them into a new table ( taxonomic table ) in which embl ids and taxonomic words were included we then selected embl ids of mammalian viruses with any of the viral family names listed in table 5 from the taxonomic table next sequences of mammalian viruses were divided into groups according to their species presented in the taxonomic table to determine the targets for hexanucleotide analysis embl ids having the longest sequence in the species were selected as the estimated genomic sequence of the virus and then a new table named sequences of viral species was prepared although the longest sequence from each species was selected some of these sequences were very short therefore we eliminated sequences that were shorter than half of the common genomic size of each viral family the resultant 1791 viral sequences were inserted into a table titled genomic sequence of viral species the frequency of the non ribosomal hexanucleotides was determined in sense and complementary strands of the sequences included in the table titled genomic sequence of viral species the strains sars cov and bpi3 were frankfurt1 and bn 1 respectively ( 12 14 ) sars cov and bpi3 were propagated by serial infection of vero e6 and mdbk cells respectively ( 15 ) vero e6 cells were routinely subcultured in 75 cm2 flasks in dmem ( sigma aldrich ) supplemented with 0 2 mm / ml l glutamine 100 u / ml penicillin 10 g / ml streptomycin and 5 ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) and maintained at 37 c in an atmosphere of 5 co2 for experimental use the cells were split once in 25 cm2 flasks and cultured until they reached 100 confluence prior to the virus infection the culture medium was replaced with 2 fbs containing dmem sars cov which was isolated as frankfurt1 and kindly provided by dr j ziebuhr ( 16 ) was used in the present study the viral infection was established in the cells with a multiplicity of infection ( m o i ) of 10 the infection of cells with sars cov virus and the subsequent treatment of sars cov rna were restricted in the p4 area in the national institute of infectious disease and the work with sars cov was performed in accordance with the rules for infectious pathogens that have been notified by the national institute of infectious disease mdbk cells were maintained in eagles minimum essential medium ( sigma aldrich ) supplemented with 5 fbs in a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 at 37 c the cells were infected with bpi3 at an m o i of 0 1 the work on infection of bpi3 was performed in accordance with the rules for pathogens that have been notified by rakuno gakuen university total rna was isolated using trizol ( invitrogen carlsbad ca ) according to the manufacturers instructions prior to cdna synthesis contaminated genomic dna in the extracted rna was digested with rnase free dnase i ( promega madison wi ) at 37 c for 1 h rna was extracted serially with phenol and chloroform precipitated with ethanol according to the standard protocol and subsequently used as a control rna for the synthesis of a model rna the entire molecule of pcineo plasmid was transcribed in vitro from a t7 promoter the synthesized 5 4 kb rna was treated with rnase free dnase i ( promega ) extracted with phenol / chloroform precipitated with ethanol and subsequently used as a test rna after quantitation the test and control rnas were mixed to estimate the sensitivity of cdna rda in various conditions first strand cdna was synthesized from the mixed rna with non ribosomal hexanucleotides by using a double stranded cdna synthesis kit ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturers protocol i e the total rna was diluted to 1 g per l and mixed with dntps the non ribosomal hexanucleotides 5 reaction buffer 0 1 m dtt and an rnase inhibitor reverse transcriptase ( superscript ii invitrogen ) was added and the mixture was incubated at 50 c for 60 min second strand cdna was synthesized with escherichia coli dna polymerase ( invitrogen ) e coli dna ligase ( invitrogen ) and rnaseh ( invitrogen ) at 16 c for 2 h double stranded cdna was digested with dpn ii and the resultant fragments were extracted from the digest by using a silicon membrane based purification kit ( gene elute purification kit sigma aldrich ) linker derived amplification of dna fragments and selective amplification steps of cdna rda were performed according to the method described by hubank and schatz ( 17 ) briefly 0 1 g of dpn ii digested double stranded cdna was ligated with rbam24 and rbam12 linkers ( 5 ) an aliquot of 1 l of the ligation solution was diluted with taq mixture ( 10 l of 10 taq buffer including 15 mm mgcl2 and 0 2 mm each of dntps ) the mixture was preheated to 72 c and then taq polymerase ( promega ) was added and the mixture was incubated at 72 c for 5 min to synthesize a complementary strand against the overhanging region of rbam24 this was immediately followed by a denaturation step ( 94 c for 2 min ) and 20 cycles of pcr ( 94 c for 1 min and 72 c for 8 min ) to non specifically amplify 200 800 bp dpn ii digested cdna fragments with linkers ( amplicons ) after amplification amplicons were redigested with dpn ii and purified with a silicon membrane based purification kit to eliminate the spliced linkers some amplicons including the test rna were religated with jbam24 and jbam12 linkers amplicons with the second linkers were mixed with a large quantity of amplicons without the test rna sequences the mixture was precipitated with ethanol and 3 m sodium acetate dissolved in 4 l of 3 ee buffer 30 mm epps n ( 2 hydroxyethyl ) piperazine n 3 propanesulfonic acid 3 mm edta ph 8 0 and covered with mineral oil after the mixture was heated to 99 c for 4 min 1 l of 5 m nacl was added and the solution was incubated at 67 c for 21 h during this incubation period amplicons from normal cellular rna with a linker included in the test amplicons were hybridized with those from uninfected cells without a linker after hybridization the reaction mixture was diluted to 100 l with reaction buffer of taq dna polymerase ( promega ) as described above amplicons having the linker sequence at both ends were amplified by a denaturation step ( 94 c for 2 min ) and 20 cycles of pcr ( 94 c for 1 min and 72 c for 3 min ) rnas extracted from virus infected cells were subjected to cdna rda as described above by using amplicons synthesized from rna obtained from uninfected cells cdna rda derived fragments in quantities ranging from 100 ng to 2 g were separated on agarose gels blotted onto a biodyne nylon membrane ( pall co ltd port washington ny ) by capillary transfer in 20 ssc ( 3 m sodium chloride and 0 3 m sodium citrate ) for 16 h and fixed to the membrane by baking in an oven at 80 c for 30 min pcineo was used as a probe for the in vitro synthesized rna a random primer labelling kit ( bcabest labeling kit takara shuzo co ltd kyoto japan ) was used for labelling with 32p and hybridized in superhybplus hybridization solution ( sigma aldrich ) according to the manufacturers protocol although amplicons are cloned into a vector to identify its sequence according to cartagena protocol on biosafety text of the protocol amplicons from sars cov infected cells should not be cloned into any plasmid therefore by performing hybridization we identified that the sequences of amplicons derived from sars cov infected cells were identical to sars cov to determine probes for sars cov the pcr products predicted from the genomic sequence and sizes of cdna rda products were amplified from the sars cov genome these pcr products were purified labelled with dig and independently hybridized using a slit of the nylon membrane blotted with amplicons derived from sars cov infected cells dig labelling and hybridization were carried out according to the manufacturers instructions provided with the dig hybridization kit ( f hoffmann la roche ltd diagnostics division basel switzerland ) hybridization was carried out with dig labelled dna probes at 65 c for 16 h in dig hybridization solution the cdna rda derived fragments were respliced with dpn ii separated on agarose gels extracted with a silicon membrane based purification kit and cloned into psport1 ( invitrogen ) plasmids that included cdna rda derived fragments were selected by colony pcr and purified with a silicon membrane based purification kit three clones of the plasmid were sequenced along with the fragment to detect pcr errors sequences of the cdna rda derived fragments were determined using a dyenamic et terminator kit ( amersham biosciences corp piscataway nj ) and an abi prism 310 sequencer ( perkinelmer life and analytical sciences inc boston ma ) with m13 forward and reverse primers ( takara shuzo ) we used the blast program on ncbi to determine sequences that were homologous to the isolated fragments to predict the major rna molecule in cellular rna we synthesized cdna from rna extracted from normal bovine cells synthesized amplicons by using random primers spliced them with dpn ii and finally subcloned them into psport1 among the sequences of 30 selected clones the sequences of 25 clones and 5 clones were highly homologous to those of ribosomal rna and a 1399 bp satellite repeat ( genbank accession no v00125 ) respectively based on this result ribosomal and satellite sequences were determined for analysing hexanucleotide frequency since the reported ribosomal sequences of mammals are highly homologous to each other we selected rat premature 18s 5 8s and 28s ribosomal sequences as ribosomal sequences for hexanucleotide frequency analysis genome sequences of sars cov and bpi3 were selected as representatives of rna viral sequence table 1 shows the probabilities number of the patterns / ( length of sequence 2 ) of hexanucleotides in the human ribosomal rna v00125 satellite repeat bpi3 and sars cov if a random sequence is assumed frequencies would be distributed according to the poissons distribution and the average of frequency would be the same as the variance of frequency although the average / variance ratios of all the four sequences were < 1 the ratio of ribosomal rna was smallest in these sequences ( table 3 ) this value suggests that the probabilities of hexamer patterns of ribosomal rna were strongly biased from random sequence based on histograms of probabilities the distribution of the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal rna differed greatly from those of v00125 satellite repeat or bpi3 ( figure 1 ) it should be noted that 8 hexanucleotides did not exist and over 90 hexanucleotides were rare in the ribosomal sequence to determine primer sequences that do not prime ribosomal rna but prime viral rna the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal rna and satellite repeat were calculated the hexamer patterns were then realigned in an ascending order according to the sum of probabilities and the 1st to 96th patterns were selected as non ribosomal hexanucleotides i e we selected 96 rarest hexanucleotide patterns ( table 2 non ribosomal hexanucleotides ) in major transcripts in normal mammalian cells on the assumption that ribosomal rna and transcripts from satellites are the most frequent transcripts in normal cells the rarity of non ribosomal hexanucleotides in comparison with non v00125 satellite and random hexamers was confirmed in reported sequences of mammalian ribosomal rnas ( table 4 ) the probabilities were relatively low in all the mammalian ribosomal sequences reported in genbank it is considered that non ribosomal hexanucleotides inefficiently primed ribosomal rnas in reverse transcription on the other hand the probabilities of non ribosomal non v00125 satellite or random hexamers were different among the satellite sequences in addition to the inefficiency to prime ribosomal rnas efficient priming of v00125 satellite repeat and bpi3 with non ribosomal hexanucleotides is shown in figure 1 to predict priming efficiency in many viruses the probability of non ribosomal hexanucleotides in known viral genomes was estimated in 1791 viral sequences in genomic sequences of viral species the median probabilities of non ribosomal hexanucleotides of all known viral sequences is 13 2 37 6 10 3 ( table 5 ) when the average probabilities were calculated in viral families the minimum probability was 3 7 10 3 in herpesviridae and the maximum probability was 44 8 10 3 in poxviridae ( table 5 ) these median values of probabilities in viral genomes were greater than those of ribosomal rnas ( table 4 ) and comparable with those of non v00125 and random hexamers ( table 5 ) these data suggest that non ribosomal hexanucleotides prime cdna synthesis in most viruses the database analysis suggests that viral rnas were efficiently primed by non ribosomal hexanucleotides in comparison with ribosomal rnas we investigated the effect of non ribosomal hexanucleotides on cdna synthesis by using in vitro synthesized plasmid rna ( artificial rna ) and total cellular rna including ribosomal rnas an autoradiogram of 32p labelled double stranded cdnas that were synthesized using non ribosomal hexanucleotides or a random primer and subsequently separated by agarose gel electrophoresis is shown in figure 2 when test and total cellular rnas were reverse transcribed individually the efficiencies of cdna synthesis from artificial rna using random and non ribosomal hexanucleotides were almost similar however the efficiency of cdna synthesis of cellular rna was markedly lower in a non ribosomal hexanucleotide primed cdna sample than in a random primer primed cdna sample ( figure 2a ) in the mixed samples of test and total cellular rnas ribosomal rnas were inefficiently reverse transcribed with non ribosomal hexanucleotides the total incorporated counts in non ribosomal hexanucleotides primed cdnas decreased with a decrease in the proportion of the test rna in the mixed rna samples ( figure 2a ) it is considered that the efficiency of reverse transcription depends on the proportions of the test rna in the mixed rnas when approximately the same counts of cdnas were loaded on the gel synthesis of ribosomal rna derived cdna ( ribosomal cdna ) was obvious in random primer primed cdnas ( figure 2b ) on the other hand the synthesis of ribosomal cdna was not obvious in the cdna primed with non ribosomal hexanucleotides a relatively large cdna derived from artificial rna could be observed even when a smaller proportion of test rna was mixed with cellular rna and non ribosomal hexanucleotide primed samples these data suggest that the relative amount of test rna derived cdna is greater in non ribosomal hexanucleotides primed samples than in random primer primed samples after the first round of cdna rda amplified fragments were observed on agarose by staining with ethidium bromide the bands that corresponded to artificial rna could be observed in 1 0 1 1 and 1 10 ( test total cellular rnas ) mixtures when cdnas were primed with a random primer on the other hand these bands could be observed in 1 0 to 1 300 rna mixtures when cdna was primed with non ribosomal hexanucleotides ( figure 3a ) this amplification of test rna was confirmed by hybridization with pcineo which was a template for in vitro rna synthesis ( figure 3b ) the hybridized bands were observed even in a lane corresponding to 1 1000 rna mixture when cdna was primed with a random primer the hybridized bands could not be observed in 1 100 1 300 and 1 1000 rna mixtures these data suggest that the lower limit of the test rna amplification decreased at least 30 times when non ribosomal hexanucleotides were used for reverse transcription when compared with the data obtained by using a random primer to amplify virus sequence from infected cells we subtracted amplicons derived from uninfected cells from those derived from virus infected cells amplicons with linkers derived from the infected cells were mixed with amplicons without linkers derived from uninfected cells at the ratio of 1 100 before a hybridization step of cdna rda at the end of the first round of cdna rda the ladders of amplified fragments were generated from bpi3 infected cells when non ribosomal hexanucleotides were used ( figure 4 ) no cdna rda derived bands were obvious when a random primer was used for reverse transcription ( data not shown ) amplified fragments from cdna rda of bpi3 infected cells were cloned into psport1 plasmid and the sequences were determined the sequences of all the cloned fragments from cdna rda were identical to the sequence of the bpi3 genome these data suggest that cdna rda with non ribosomal hexanucleotides enables the identification of the bpi3 genome sequence from infected cells similar to bpi3 cdna fragments derived from sars cov were also amplified from sars cov infected cells ( figure 5 ) viral origin of the amplified fragments was confirmed by hybridization ( figure 5b ) and pcr amplification by sars cov specific primers ( figure 5a ) these results indicate that genomic fragments of sars cov can also be isolated by this method it is well known that 3 5 and 30 of cellular rna are estimated to be messenger and ribosomal rna respectively the frequency of ribosomal rna has been estimated by competitive pcr and real time pcr to be 10 000 copies per cell ( 18 ) the amount of ribosomal rna has been reported to be 1000 fold greater than that of frequently transcribed mrna such as beta actin and g6pdh thus the repertoire of cdna would be strongly affected by ribosomal rna this influence of ribosomal rna has been avoided by oligo ( dt ) selection alternative strategy for the elimination of ribosomal rna from total rna however has not been developed therefore there have been only a few applications of cdna rda for non poly ( a ) rna such as those in viral genomes in this study we developed a new strategy for the elimination of ribosomal rna in cdna rda through the construction of a hexanucleotide mixture and demonstrated its efficiency in cdna rda the main purpose of pcr is specific amplification of a gene however methods using multiple primers for simultaneous gene amplification have been recently employed for dna chip methods in order to simultaneously detect multiple genes by using a dna chip mixed oligonucleotides have been used as a primer for reverse transcription this usage of mixed primers was based on the assumption that the specificity of primers was equal to the summation of the specificity of each primer thus we searched for primers that do not prime ribosomal rnas by frequency analysis of hexanucleotides the frequency and distribution of oligonucleotides in mammalian and viral genomes have been studied to search for common motifs that might be used for controlling cellular functions ( 19 23 ) volinia et al ( 22 ) found sets of common decamers that can be used for the control of transcription control signals or for the common amplification of viruses programs for frequency analysis have been useful for searching common oligonucleotides in many subsets of sequences on the other hand database programming is useful not only for searching common oligonucleotides but also for searching oligonucleotides that do not exist in a subset of sequences in this study we found that there were hexanucleotide patterns that were rare or that did not exist in ribosomal rna sequences we also showed that sequences of 96 selected non ribosomal hexanucleotides are normally present in known viral sequences ( table 5 ) in the experiment for the determination of the effect of non ribosomal hexanucleotides we used a mixture of artificially synthesized and total cellular rnas the probabilities of hexanucleotide patterns in the sequence of pcineo was different from ribosomal rna ( 18 4 10 3 22 4 10 3 and 23 0 10 3 for non ribosomal non v00125 and random hexamers respectively ) the artificially synthesized rna included 30 priming sites for non ribosomal hexanucleotides and was efficiently reverse transcribed ( figure 2 ) in the model experiments cdna rda with non ribosomal hexanucleotides efficiently reverse transcribed and specifically amplified the extracellular test rna in the mixed rna ( figure 3 ) cdna rda derived detection of the artificial rna was 30 fold more sensitive when non ribosomal hexanucleotides were used than when random hexamers were used these results suggest that non ribosomal hexanucleotides dramatically improve the detection efficiency of cdna rda the common existence of non ribosomal hexanucleotides in known viral genomes ( table 5 ) and the improved sensitivity for the amplification of a non ribosomal sequence in the mixed rnas ( figure 3 ) suggest that non ribosomal hexanucleotides could be used for non specific detection of a viral sequence in infected cells however the sensitivity for sequence detection may be low when compared with that of common pcr using specific primers thus the usage of this method might be restricted to infected cells that contain many copies of a virus the copy number of rna viruses is dependent on the virus species host cells and replicative and productive state of viruses in our experiment we detected 3 ng of contaminated rnas in 1 g of total rna although this sensitivity is considerably lower than that of normal pcr our experiments on sars cov and bpi3 suggest that the sensitivity of cdna rda with non ribosomal hexanucleotides is sufficient to detect these viruses in productively infected cells additionally this method can be applied to most productive viruses since sense and complementary sequences of non ribosomal hexanucleotides were found to exist in most of the known virus sequences in genbank ( table 5 ) in conclusion this method could be applied as an alternative method for the detection of any emerging viruses supplementary material is available at nar online,
754nln40,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1083427/,"katri makelainen, kristiina makinen",factors affecting translation at the programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting site of cocksfoot mottle virus rna in vivo,,the principal mechanism of translation is the accurate decoding of the triplet codon sequences in one reading frame of mrna specific signals built into the mrna sequences can cause deviations from this rule viruses exploit several translational recoding mechanisms including translational hopping stop codon readthrough and programmed ribosomal frameshifting ( prf ) reviewed in ( 12 ) for regulating the amount of proteins produced from their polyproteins for positive stranded rna viruses 1 prf is the prevailing recoding mechanism and an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral proteins most viral 1 prf signals are regulating the production of replication associated proteins depending on the virus the efficiency of 1 prf can vary between 1 and 40 ( 3 ) and changes in the efficiency can inhibit virus assembly and replication ( 4 6 ) therefore 1 prf can be regarded as a potential target for antiviral agents ( 47 ) however the development of efficient antiviral drugs is still hindered since little is known about the trans acting factors and the biophysical parameters affecting the 1 prf efficiencies database searches have identified putative frameshift signals from a substantial number of chromosomally encoded eukaryotic mrnas ( 8 ) thus 1 prf may also have an impact on the complexity of the proteome of several eukaryotic organisms two cis acting signals a slippery heptamer x xxy yyz ( the incoming reading frame indicated ) and a downstream secondary structure direct the slippage and are therefore essential for this event ( 9 ) 1 prf takes place after the accommodation step in the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of both trnas into the overlapping 1 frame xxx yyy ( 910 ) the sequence of the heptamer allows post slippage base pairing between the non wobble bases of the trnas and the new 1 frame codons of the mrna downstream rna secondary structures reviewed in ( 11 ) force the ribosomes to pause and place the ribosomal a and p sites correctly over the slippery sequence ( 12 ) however the pausing of the ribosomes is not sufficient for 1 prf to occur ( 13 ) in fact the duration of the halt does not necessarily correlate with the level of the 1 prf observed ( 12 ) crystallographic molecular biochemical and genetic studies suggest that a pseudoknot restricts the movement of the mrna during the trna accommodation step of elongation by filling the entrance of the ribosomal mrna tunnel ( 14 ) this restriction can be eased either by unwinding the pseudoknot which allows the mrna to move forward or by a slippage of the mrna one nucleotide backwards chemical agents such as antibiotics certain mutations in the translation apparatus and in translation elongation factors that change the translation fidelity and kinetics have been shown to influence 1 prf efficiency ( 1015 ) reviewed in ( 16 ) the parameters known to contribute to the efficiency of 1 prf are the sequence of the slippery heptamer the downstream secondary structure and the length and sequence of the spacer between the two cis acting signals up and downstream sequences such as termination codons in the vicinity of the 1 prf signals or even several kilobases away from them can affect the 1 prf efficiencies ( 317 22 ) a specific sequence in the barley yellow dwarf virus ( bydv ) 3 untranslated region ( utr ) 4 kb downstream from the slippage site is vital for 1 prf ( 619 ) a stimulating effect is achieved through the formation of a tertiary structure where complementary nucleotides from the 3 utr base pair with a single stranded bulge in the cis acting stem loop ( 6 ) human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) was also shown to require a more complex secondary structure instead of a simple stem loop for optimal 1 prf in vivo ( 2122 ) these investigations suggest that 1 prf studies carried out with minimal frameshift signals may lead to inaccurate estimates of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral protein products during infection cocksfoot mottle virus ( cfmv genus sobemovirus ) infects a few monocotyledonous plant species such as barley oats and wheat it has a monopartite single stranded 4082 nt long positive sense rna genome ( 2324 ) the polyprotein of cfmv is translated from two overlapping open reading frames ( orfs ) 2a and 2b by a 1 prf mechanism ( 25 ) in this study we wanted to determine the in vivo 1 prf efficiency guided by the cfmv u uua aac heptamer and the stem loop structure in addition to the minimal signal ( 18 ) we decided to test the effect of flanking cfmv sequences for their ability to contribute to 1 prf we found that the surrounding viral sequences promoted more efficient 1 prf than the minimal signal sequence in vivo when measured with the dual reporter vector system developed by stahl et al ( 26 ) therefore we carried out an expression pattern and deletion analysis to understand the molecular basis of the observed upregulation in addition we critically analysed the suitability of the implemented experimental system for this type of a recoding study an interesting possibility is that the viral proteins produced via 1 prf could regulate 1 prf this hypothesis was tested by co expressing the cfmv proteins p27 and replicase together with the dual reporter vectors three regions from the cfmv polyprotein orfs ( figure 1a ) were cloned into the nhei and bcli sites between the lacz and the luc orfs in pac74 ( 26 ) this dual reporter vector was a generous gift from dr j rousset of the universite paris sud france the inserted sequences 1602 1720 ( a region ) 1386 2137 ( b region ) and 1551 1900 ( c region ) were amplified by pcr using pab 21 as a template ( 18 ) primers were used to introduce nhei and bglii sites to the flanking ends of the inserts since nhei digestion removed lacz orf it was reintroduced into the plasmids as a final cloning step the resulting plasmids were named pac a pac b and pac c corresponding inframe controls where one nucleotide was added in front of the slippery heptamer were generated by pcr based mutagenesis ( exsite stratagene ) and named as pac am pac bm and pac cm respectively deletion plasmids pac ab / abm ( 1602 2137 ) pac ac / acm ( 1602 1900 ) pac ba / bam ( 1386 1720 ) and pac ca / cam ( 1551 1720 ) were also generated the target sequences are shown in figure 1b the base numbering refers to the cfmv genome as in ( 23 ) transcription was driven from sv40 promoter plasmids encoded leucine ( leu2 ) and lactamase ( ampicillin resistance ) as selective markers plasmids were transformed into saccharomyces cerevisiae h23 mat hsp150 ura3 ura3 1 his3 11 15leu2 3 112trp1 1 ade2 1 can100 dual reporter plasmid pac1789 and the inframe control pac1790 containing a 53 bp sequence from the hiv 1 frameshift region ( 26 ) were used as a positive control for monitoring the 1 prf efficiency to analyse the proteins produced during 1 prf lacz a / am / b / bm / c / cm fluc fragments were cloned inframe with the n terminal 6xhistidine tag in pyes2 / nt kpni and xhoi sites ( invitrogen ) reporter fusions were amplified by pcr using pac a / am pac b / bm or pac c / cm as templates the resulting plasmids were named pyes2 / nt a / am b / bm and c / cm protein expression was regulated from gal1 promoter two cfmv encoded proteins p27 ( c terminal end of orf2a ) and replicase ( orf2b ) were cloned into pyes2 ( invitrogen ) translation initiation codons were introduced within the oligonucleotides during pcr the resulting plasmids were named pyes p27 and pyes rep control plasmids which lacked the translation initiation codons were prepared by pcr based mutagenesis ( pyes p27 aug and pyes rep aug ) and the resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing plasmids encoded auxotrophic marker for uracil ( ura3 ) all cloning steps were performed using standard protocols plasmids were amplified either in escherichia coli dh5 or jm110 and purified with qiagen columns inserts were verified by sequencing yeast transformations were done using the liac method ( 27 ) and transformants were selected on a synthetic minimal defined medium ( sc ) lacking the corresponding auxotrophic marker ( s ) encoded by the used plasmid ( s ) bacteria ( e coli dh5 ) were grown in lb medium containing ampicillin whereas yeast cells were grown either in ypd or in an sc medium protein expression from gal1 promoter was repressed during growth at sc medium containing 2 glucose expression was induced by replacing glucose with 2 galactose and 1 raffinose reporter fusions were expressed in s cerevisiae invsc1 ( his3 1 / his3 1 leu2 / leu2 trp1 289 / trp1 289 ura3 52 / ura3 52 ) ( invitrogen ) overnight protein fusions were purified in denaturing conditions using ni nta agarose ( qiagen ) and analysed in 6 sds page gels proteins were visualized either by coomassie staining or by using antisera raised against the cfmv polyprotein region 1386 1724 encoding cfmv vpg ( 28 ) protein antibody complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti rabbit antibodies ( sigma ) and ecl chemiluminescent reagents ( amersham ) plasmids pyes p27 pyes rep pyes p27 aug pyes rep aug or empty pyes2 were co expressed with pac a or with the corresponding pac am inframe control in s cerevisiae egy48 strain ( mat ura3 trp1 his3 6lexaop leu2 ) ( invitrogen ) transformants were grown overnight in sc leu ura media in non inducing conditions and used to inoculate induction medium cells were harvested at late logarithmic phase expression of the cfmv proteins was confirmed by western blotting using polyclonal antisera against the cfmv orf 2a and 2b proteins ( 28 ) determining the enzymatic activities as described below monitored the effect of cfmv p27 and replicase on 1 prf for the in vitro analysis the lacz gene of pac a / am b / bm and c / cm vectors was replaced with pcr amplified renilla luciferase ( rluc ) gene from prlnull vector ( promega ) the resulting pacrf plasmids were used as templates for pcr in order to add t7 promoter upstream of the rluc gene these pcr products were used for rna synthesis with ribomax kit ( promega ) transcripts were treated with rq1 dnase ( promega ) purified with qiagen rneasy columns and quantified spectrophotometrically the integrity of the transcripts was checked in agarose gels in vitro translations were carried out in wheat germ extract ( wge ) according to the manufacturers protocols ( promega ) reactions were incubated in room temperature for 60 min and stopped on ice prior to enzymatic measurements cell cultures were started from at least three independent clones and grown until the late exponential phase cells were collected by centrifugation frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 70 c bacterial cells were lysed by sonication ( 3 15 s ) and yeasts by vortexing with glass beads ( 0 5 vol ) in + 4 c for 30 min lysates were cleared by centrifugation and enzymatic activities were determined immediately total protein concentrations were measured by using a bradford protein assay reagent ( bio rad ) galactosidase ( lacz ) and firefly or renilla luciferase ( luc or ruc ) activities were measured with commercial kits from promega according to the manufacturers instructions lacz activity was determined as the colour intensity at a414 nm luciferase activities were measured as relative light units ( rlus ) with luminometer ( biohit or thermolabsystems ) 1 prf efficiencies were calculated from normalized firefly luciferase activities with the following formula ( luc activity from the test construct ) / ( lacz or ruc activity from the test construct ) / ( luc activity from the inframe control ) / ( lacz or ruc activity from the inframe control ) 100 in cfmv the motif for 1 prf is the slippery heptamer u uua aac and a stem loop structure 7 nt downstream ( 25 ) the efficiency of 1 prf directed by cfmv cis acting signals was assayed in vivo using a dual reporter vector system ( figure 1a ) since reporters are produced from one single mrna factors that affect the stability of the mrna as well as the rate of translation initiation have a similar influence on the expression of both reporters and these variations can be monitored as changes in the activity of the upstream reporter we quantified 1 prf by comparing the galactosidase normalized firefly luciferase activities derived from the test constructs via 1 prf to those obtained from the inframe controls in which identical galactosidase cfmv firefly luciferase fusions are produced without 1 prf due to the added nucleotide in front of the slippery heptamer ( see figure 1a ) similar vectors have been shown to detect even small changes in the recoding efficiencies resulting from alterations in the cis or trans acting factors ( 2629 32 ) three inserts of varied lengths from the cfmv polyprotein encoding region ( orf2a / 2b ) were introduced between the two reporters ( figure 1b ) the a region which at 119 bp was the shortest represented approximately the minimal frameshift signal proven to be functional in vitro ( 18 ) the longest region was the b insert at 752 bp it started from the 5 terminus of the 12 kda viral genome linked protein ( vpg ) gene and continued to the end of orf2a this region encodes cfmv protein p27 with an unknown function ( 28 ) since the minimal requirements for the functional frameshift signal in vivo were not known an intermediate 349 bp c sequence was also selected for the analysis a well characterized 53 bp frameshift cassette derived from hiv 1 rna was used as a positive control our results regarding the hiv 1 prf efficiency 0 7 0 1 in bacteria and 4 5 1 1 in yeast ( figure 2 ) are corroborated by those published earlier ( 263334 ) indicating that our dual reporter system was fully functional galactosidase has been shown to retain its specific activity well irrespective of the c terminal fusions ( 35 ) this is important since the first reporter serves to control the variations among the abundance and translation rates of the studied mrnas ( 2630 ) in addition to changes in specific activities heterologous fusions can cause alterations in the solubility and conformation which can expose cryptic protease target sites and reduce the stability of the proteins ( 36 ) therefore for a reliable quantification of 1 prf it was important to test that equimolar amounts of fusions produced from the corresponding test and control constructs had similar enzymatic activities most inframe controls and the analogous test constructs had equal absolute galactosidase activities ( table 1 ) comparable results were obtained if activities were normalized with total protein concentration ( data not shown ) these results indicated that the length of the fusion as such did not affect the specific activities the galactosidase activity from pac am inframe control was also comparable to activity obtained from an empty pac74 where this enzyme has no fusion ( data not shown ) this further supported the view that the few observed variations in the galactosidase activities more likely resulted from the changes in translatability or stability of the transcripts in addition to pac cm two inframe controls pac am and pac acm showed 25 lower galactosidase activities when compared to the equivalent test constructs ( table 1 ) indicating that the productivity from these constructs was reduced taken together galactosidase seemed to fit well to be used as the first reporter and thus normalization factor in the in vivo experiments of this study cfmv frameshift signals generated significant 1 prf in yeast 1 prf level measured from pac a was 3 fold higher than from hiv rna ( figure 2a and b ) the extent of 1 prf directed by the minimal region a in yeast 14 4 1 9 was at the same level as that reported for the cfmv minimal frameshift signal in vitro ( 12 7 ) ( 18 ) in contrast to our earlier in vitro observations ( 18 ) the longer cfmv sequences upregulated 1 prf in vivo in yeast the level of upregulation was 2 fold for pac b the 1 prf frequency being 26 3 and almost 5 fold for pac c resulting in efficiency close to 70 ( figure 2a ) which is an extremely high value if compared to the other values published earlier ( 3 ) cfmv frameshift signals directed 1 prf at a lower level in bacteria than in yeast ( figure 2b ) the extent of 1 prf directed by region a in bacteria was 2 4 0 7 as in yeast the longest b region stimulated 1 prf 2 fold in bacteria when compared with pac a however region c did not further improve 1 prf but programmed 1 prf to similar levels as pac b the percentages being 4 7 1 6 for pac c and 5 5 1 5 for pac b to identify the sequence ( s ) responsible for the enhancement of 1 prf in vivo a deletion analysis was carried out the 5 or the 3 sequences flanking the a region were deleted from pac b / bm or pac c / cm as indicated in figure 1b which generated vectors pac ab / abm pac ba / bam pac ac / acm and pac ca / cam 1 prf frequencies were determined in yeast ( figure 2c ) increased 1 prf was observed in all deletion constructs in comparison to the 1 prf directed by the a region the ba and ab regions promoted 1 prf as efficiently as the b region whereas regions ca and ac were better than region a but not as good as region b in other words the presence of nucleotides 1386 1720 or downstream nucleotides 1602 2137 was sufficient to increase 1 prf to the level directed by the region b thus the deletion analysis did not identify single specific sequence region as being responsible for the increased 1 prf frequencies the expression pattern of the test and control constructs was analysed to understand the basis for the observed upregulation in yeast cassettes containing the reporters and the studied intercistronic sequences were expressed and purified as n terminal histidine fusions this allowed us to capture all the n terminally intact products the affinity purified proteins were separated in sds page gels and visualized either by coomassie staining ( data not shown ) or by western blotting with the cfmv specific anti vpg antibodies the expected galactosidase cfmv fusions terminating at the end of the 0 frame in the test constructs were detected also the longer transframe galactosidase cfmv firefly luciferase fusion proteins were present in both the test and the inframe constructs ( figure 3 ) comparison of the coomassie stained gels with the western blots revealed that the antisera recognized the products terminating at the cfmv encoding regions better than the transframe products furthermore the small size of the cfmv specific region in the pyes2 / nt am decreased the binding of the antibodies to these inframe control fusions thus this data were not suitable for quantitative analysis of 1 prf interestingly an additional protein which reacted with cfmv specific antisera was co purified from the cells expressing pyes2 / nt bm and pyes2 / nt cm inframe controls ( figure 3 ) the size of these fusions suggested that translation had terminated approximately at the site for 1 prf signals if such putative termination products were also present in cells expressing the test constructs the correctly terminated 0 frame products in the western blots masked these products a closer look at the absolute galactosidase and firefly luciferase activities revealed that firefly luciferase expression from pac cm was clearly reduced ( data not shown ) in fact expression from the inframe control was comparable to the corresponding pac c test construct this was also obvious when the firefly luciferase activities were normalized with the total protein amount after setting the activity from pac am to a relative value of one the corresponding values from pac bm and pac cm were 0 80 and 0 28 although the galactosidase measurements ( table 1 ) suggested that the overall translatability of the pac cm mrna was also reduced to some extent it explained the decrease in firefly luciferase expression only partially in the light of these findings the extremely high 1 prf frequency estimate calculated for the c region could be explained with more frequent translation termination at the frameshift signals of the pac cm mrna which reduced firefly luciferase activity in relation to galactosidase 1 prf was also assayed in vitro in wge although lacz encoding gene is suitable for the in vivo studies it is an unsuitable first reporter for the in vitro determination of 1 prf efficiencies due to its big size ( 30 ) in good agreement with this we observed several unexpected products in the in vitro translations programmed with lacz cfmv luc mrnas ( data not shown ) renilla luciferase has been shown to retain its specific activity irrespective of the c terminal fusions ( 30 ) therefore we decided to use rluc cfmv luc transcripts to determine the 1 prf efficiencies in the cell free system first we verified the suitability of renilla luciferase for the intended in vitro experiments as described in ( 30 ) transcripts encoding monocistronic renilla luciferase and renilla luciferase fused to firefly luciferase ( rluc am / cm luc ) were mixed in different ratios and used to program the in vitro translations increasing concentrations of transcripts encoding the rluc am luc fusion resulted in linearly growing firefly luciferase activities at the same time renilla luciferase activities remained constant which showed that its enzymatic activity was not sensitive to the c terminal fusions ( figure 4a ) similar results were obtained with rluc cm luc mrna ( data not shown ) 1 prf efficiencies were then determined with transcripts that contained cfmv regions a b and c and their corresponding inframe controls in all cases slightly higher 1 prf frequencies were obtained than in vivo in nice correlation with the in vivo results enhanced 1 prf was observed with the region b although the effect was weaker than in vivo in this context region c did not differ from the minimal region a in its capacity to program 1 prf ( figure 4b ) the ratio between the cfmv p27 and replicase is regulated by 1 prf during cfmv infection ( 28 ) we studied whether these proteins could regulate the 1 prf process p27 replicase or an empty expression vector was co expressed in yeast together with the dual reporter vectors containing the minimal 1 prf test and inframe control regions as intergenic sequences ( pac a and am ) p27 and replicase expression was verified by a western blot analysis ( figure 5 ) a faint band having nearly the same mobility as the replicase was detected in cells grown under repressing conditions however due to the small size difference this protein was not regarded as replicase enzymatic activities were measured from yeast lysates prepared from induced cultures measurements showed comparable levels of galactosidase in all the samples indicating that p27 or replicase expression did not affect the stability of the dual reporter mrna or the translatability of the first reporter ( table 2 ) the effect of p27 or replicase expression was monitored by comparing the reporter activity ratios to those measured from cells harbouring the empty expression plasmids ( table 2 ) co expression of cfmv replicase did not affect the normalized firefly luciferase expression ( luc / lacz ) from the inframe control whereas slightly increased luciferase expression from the test construct was observed in contrast p27 expression reduced firefly luciferase expression both from the test and the inframe constructs the effect was stronger in the presence of inframe control as normalized firefly luciferase levels reached only 54 of expression measured from the empty vector control to verify that the observed differences in firefly luciferase production depended on the studied cfmv proteins we co expressed the dual reporter vectors with plasmids having the first translation initiation codons of p27 and replicase deleted ( pyes p27 aug and pyes rep aug ) western blot analysis with antisera against orf2a or 2b did not detect any proteins produced from these vectors ( data not shown ) the obtained luc / lacz ratios were compared to those measured from cells expressing the cfmv proteins ( pyes p27 or pyes rep ) luc / lacz ratios measured from cells expressing replicase were slightly lower than the ratios calculated from cells harbouring pyes rep aug plasmids being 90 when co expressed with pac a and 84 when co expressed with pac am in the presence of p27 luc / lacz ratio of pac a reached 81 of expression measured from cells transformed with pyes p27 aug again the effect of p27 expression was more evident with pac am inframe control as p27 expression reduced luc / lacz ratio to half ( 48 ) when compared to the corresponding value measured from the cells harbouring pyes p27 aug this verified that cfmv p27 was able to reduce the downstream reporter expression from dual reporter mrnas since cfmv p27 had a proportionally stronger effect to firefly luciferase production from the inframe control mrnas in comparison to the test mrnas ( table 2 ) the calculated 1 prf efficiency increased from 14 7 to 22 4 since 1 prf studies are affected by a huge number of different parameters it is not an easy task to determine the real ratio between the proteins produced via this mechanism in vivo however in viral systems the efficiency of 1 prf is an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral protein products which must be rigidly maintained for efficient propagation of the virus for example frameshifting in retroviruses determines the ratio of structural ( gag ) to enzymatic ( gag pol ) proteins and plays a critical role in viral particle assembly ( 5 ) in this study the capacity of cfmv frameshift signals to direct efficient 1 prf was analysed in vivo by using dual reporter vectors the length of the cfmv sequence clearly affected the actual efficiency percent in vivo the prf efficiency was elevated when longer viral sequences were directing the 1 prf but the deletion analysis did not identify any specific region as being solely responsible for the enhancement up and downstream sequences nearby or far away from the cis acting signals have been reported to enhance 1 prf in other viruses such as hiv human t cell leukaemia virus and bydv ( 61920 ) also out of frame stop codons have been shown to influence 1 prf frequency in vitro in retroviruses ( 17 ) and in cfmv ( 18 ) a study on the spacer sequences located between the cis acting signals showed that high slippage frequencies were obtained when the first three nucleotides were g / u g / a and g / a the first two being the most important ( 37 ) in cfmv the spacer starts with uac which partially explains the capacity of the cfmv sequence to promote high slippage levels in this study the observed enhancement of 1 prf was however caused by sequences that were not in the immediate vicinity of the slippery sequence thus indicating that cfmv sequences further away also have an influence on the level of frameshifting in vivo we conclude that the most reliable estimates for 1 prf and consequently for the amount of replicase versus the 0 frame translation product p27 can be obtained only by using the full length viral sequences in reality such a study would however be hampered by the non quantitative nature of the western blot analysis the presence of different polyprotein processing intermediates and the differences in the stabilities of the end products in the infected cells the overall competence of cfmv signals to direct 1 prf was high when compared to related plant viruses such as potato leaf roll virus and bydv 1 prf values of 1 have been reported for these viruses when measured with reporter based assays ( 638 ) we can hypothesize that one reason for the high efficiency is the slippery trnaasn encoding the aac triplet of the cfmv heptamer equal u uua aac slippery heptamer has been measured to induce 20 40 of 1 prf in a diversity of animal viruses ( 39 ) reviewed in ( 3 ) the low fitness of cfmv 1 prf signals in bacteria is in agreement with the poor functioning of the eukaryotic slippery heptamers of the order x xxa aac in prokaryotes ( 40 42 ) ibv rna having an identical shifty heptamer has been shown to direct 1 prf at similar 2 3 level in bacteria ( 41 ) a recent study reported that xxxaaac heptamers dictate 1 prf to occur via the slippage of two adjacent trnas placed over the heptamer irrespective of whether the host is an eukaryote or a prokaryote ( 42 ) therefore the inability of prokaryotic translation systems to direct efficient 1 prf from this heptamer is not an inherited property of prokaryotic trnaasn but results from differences in the ribosomes ( 42 ) paused ribosomes can pass the 1 prf site by 1 frameshifting resumption of 0 frame translation or termination ( 43 ) transient polypeptide intermediates that result from the pausing of ribosomes in the slippery sequences have been observed during ibv and s cerevisiae l a virus polyprotein synthesis ( 12134344 ) a pseudoknot structure formed by ibv mrna causes a translational pause at fixed position upstream the secondary structure regardless of whether the slippery heptamer is present or absent ( 12 ) based on the findings of this study we propose that also here a certain percent of ribosomes stalled at the secondary structure of the frameshift site in our inframe control and test mrnas in yeast and this led to the prematurely terminated products observed with the inframe control constructs pac bm and cm although not unambiguously proven by this study high frequency of termination of translation especially at the frameshift site of the pac cm mrna would nicely explain the extremely high calculated 1 prf efficiency factors that change the translation fidelity and kinetics have been shown to influence 1 prf efficiency ( 1015 ) reviewed in ( 16 ) autoregulation of + 1 frameshifting by mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has been reported ( 45 ) this mechanism allows modulation of frameshifting frequency according to the cellular concentration of polyamines one could speculate that such a regulation mechanism could also be useful to adjust the amounts of the replication associated proteins to match the requirements of different phases in viral replication cycle this hypothesis was studied by expressing cfmv proteins p27 and replicase together with pac a and pac am in yeast cells since galactosidase production remained constant regardless of the presence or absence of cfmv proteins they did not interfere with translation initiation from pac a / am mrnas per se however p27 expression caused a reduction in the firefly luciferase production especially from the inframe control whereas replicase production only slightly increased the firefly luciferase production from pac a but not from pac am since replicase expression had only a faint effect on the normalized firefly luciferase production via 1 prf our conclusion is that cfmv replicase had no pronounced effect on translation at the frameshift site co expression of the non translatable form of p27 with the dual reporter vectors verified that p27 truly affected firefly luciferase expression on the protein level therefore we propose that cfmv protein p27 may influence translation at the frameshift site if cfmv p27 indeed interferes with viral protein synthesis during cfmv infection the mechanism its specificity and the possible biological role needs to be elucidated in the future,

sugden",subversion of cellular autophagosomal machinery by rna viruses,,upon infection by poliovirus and many other positive strand rna viruses dramatic changes are rapidly induced in the cellular environment poliovirus infection causes the massive rearrangement of intracellular membranes with double membraned vesicles 200 400 nm in diameter accumulating in the cytoplasm 12 immunoelectron microscopy has revealed that the cytoplasmic surfaces of these membranous vesicles are the sites of viral rna replication 345 and indeed all known positive strand rna viruses of eukaryotic cells replicate their rna on cytoplasmic membranes it is thought that one function for membrane localization of viral rna replication proteins is to promote their oligomerization 67 it has been noted previously that several of the features displayed by the vesicles induced during poliovirus infection 12 are known to be shared with cellular membranous structures termed autophagosomes during cellular autophagy cells break down cytoplasmic proteins and organelles within autophagosomes double membraned structures that become degradative upon maturation originally identified as a process induced by cellular starvation autophagy is now appreciated as a cellular response to a variety of stimuli including hormone treatment and is a feature of normal development in several organisms ( reviewed in 8 ) in mammalian cells two chemical inducers of autophagy are tamoxifen 910 and rapamycin 111213 cells that express the estrogen receptor respond to tamoxifen treatment by accumulating large amounts of autophagosomes 910 rapamycin inhibits the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin a known repressor of the autophagic pathway ( reviewed in 14 ) in yeast formation and maturation of autophagosomes requires the functions of many genes ( reviewed in 15 ) human homologs of several of the yeast autophagy genes have been recently identified including lc3 the human homolog of atg8p and it is likely that much of the autophagic pathway is conserved 161718 in mammalian cells the formation and maturation of autophagosomes involves the stepwise acquisition of proteins from disparate cellular compartments ( reviewed in 192021 ) nascent autophagosomes form either de novo 2223 or from the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) 2425 and comprise cellular cytoplasm surrounded by two lipid bilayers that fuse from a c shaped intermediate although relatively protein poor 2226 they have been shown to contain a modified lipidated form of lc3 16 as maturation proceeds the late autophagosome acquires lamp1 before lysosomal fusion 16252728 which defines the mature autolysosome mature autolysosomes are no longer surrounded by double membranes and having degraded the inner membrane and much of the cytosolic contents become electron dense 2729 various intermediates among these stages have also been visualized including incompletely fused double membranes and incompletely degraded inner membranes 232425 although poliovirus induced vesicles display several hallmarks of autophagosomes other origins for the poliovirus induced vesicles have been suggested 303132 poliovirus rna replication is known to be inhibited by brefeldin a which has led to the suggestion that the virally induced vesicles might derive from the copi pathway a known target of brefeldin a 323334 however this would be inconsistent with the apparent origin of the poliovirus induced vesicles from the er many images consistent with the budding of the poliovirus induced vesicles directly from the er have been reported 331 furthermore poliovirus proteins 2bc and 3a induce the formation of vesicles that are biochemically and ultrastructurally similar to those formed in poliovirus infected cells 35 the 3a protein and 2c a proteolytic product of 2bc localize to the er when expressed in isolation 3536 therefore it is likely that poliovirus proteins 3a and 2bc or larger precursors localize to the er early in infection and subsequently promote vesiculation from er membranes poliovirus induced vesicles have been shown to contain human copii proteins sec13p and sec31p early in their formation leading to the hypothesis that they are modified copii vesicles subverted from the anterograde transport pathway 31 although this is an attractive suggestion it is incongruent with other findings concerning the poliovirus induced vesicles their frequently observed double membraned morphology their cytosolic contents and the abundance of components from throughout the secretory pathway including lamp1 a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes 1235 furthermore in saccharomyces cerevisiae components of the copii pathway encoded by the sec12 16 23 and 24 genes are known to be required for autophagy 373839 making it possible that the sec13p and sec31p proteins could have other functions in addition to their known roles in anterograde traffic the size of the poliovirus induced vesicles at 200 400 nm in diameter does not immediately suggest whether they are related to the copii or autophagosomal pathways typical diameters of copii vesicles and autophagosomes are 50 100 nm 4041 and 500 1000 nm respectively 2425 finally the idea that poliovirus infection induces autophagosome formation to facilitate viral growth is surprising in view of existing data that autophagy is an effective antimicrobial host response in many cases ( reviewed in 4243 ) during herpes virus infection there is good correlation between the induction of autophagy and the presence of effective antiviral responses the process of autophagy is thought to be destructive to herpes virus because mutant viruses that fail to inhibit autophagy and other antiviral responses showed large decreases in yield 44 during streptococcus infection genetic disruption of the autophagy pathway in the infected host cells resulted in increased bacterial yield consistent with a role for autophagy in bacterial clearance 45 specific markers for autophagosome formation have become available facilitating the identification of membranes derived from the autophagic pathway ( reviewed in 4346 ) here we explore the role of several constituents of autophagosome machinery in poliovirus and rhinovirus infected cells by monitoring the presence of autophagosomal protein lc3 in virally induced vesicles the acquisition of colocalization of lc3 and lamp1 in virally infected cells the viral induction of punctate structures that stain with monodansylcadaverine ( mdc ) and the effects of perturbing the autophagosomal pathway pharmacologically and via rna interference on intracellular and extracellular virus yield our data support the hypothesis that poliovirus and likely the closely related rhinovirus induce the formation of autophagosome like structures to serve as the membrane scaffolds for rna replication we further suggest that double membraned vesicles by forming a luminal cytoplasmic compartment may facilitate prelytic viral exit from infected cells to ask whether the membranes on which poliovirus rna replication complexes assemble contain constituents of autophagosomes we monitored the localization of both lc3 a specific marker of autophagosomes and 3a a critical component of the poliovirus rna replication complex in infected cells lc3 was expressed via dna transfection as an amino terminal fusion with green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) as can be seen in figure 1 the punctate gfp lc3 signal colocalized with that of poliovirus rna replication protein 3a as visualized by immunofluorescence no colocalization with poliovirus 3a protein was seen when gfp was not fused to lc3 therefore the membranous structures to which 3a and other components of the poliovirus rna replication complex localize 3 can recruit lc3 in nonautophagic cells lc3 originally identified as a microtubule associated protein 47 and lamp1 a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes do not colocalize however during autophagy lc3 has been shown to colocalize with lysosomal protein lamp1 defining the maturation of the nascent autophagosome to the autophagosome 284849 this process can be seen in figure 2a in which lc3 and lamp1 were shown to colocalize almost completely in mcf 7 cells upon treatment with tamoxifen a known inducer of autophagy similarly rapamycin treatment of hela cells led to the colocalization of gfp lc3 and lamp 1 while they remained distinct in untreated cells ( figure 2a ) by 3 h postinfection with poliovirus the lamp1 and gfp lc3 signals in hela cells also began to colocalize ( figure 2b ) this time corresponds to the beginning of viral rna synthesis in infected hela cells 50 by 4 5 h postinfection the lamp1 and gfp lc3 signals had merged almost completely ( figure 2b ) the colocalization of gfp lc3 and lamp1 characteristic of autophagosome formation was also seen in cells infected with either of two different serotypes of human rhinovirus ( figure 2c ) expression of poliovirus proteins 2bc and 3a in isolation can induce the formation of double membraned vesicles that display biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those formed in poliovirus infected cells 35 however expression of poliovirus protein 2bc alone has been shown to induce the formation of single membraned vesicles in both mammalian cells and s cerevisiae 4355152 expression of poliovirus 3a protein in isolation on the other hand reduces the rate of er to golgi traffic and distends er membranes 3653 to test whether 2bc 3a or both were sufficient to induce colocalization of gfp lc3 and lamp1 as observed in poliovirus infected cells proteins 2bc and 3a were expressed singly or in combination in 293t cells in the presence of gfp lc3 as shown in figure 3 colocalization of gfp lc3 and lamp1 was not observed in control cells or in cells that expressed either 2bc or 3a in isolation however coexpression of 2bc and 3a caused gfp lc3 and lamp1 to colocalize ( figure 3a ) as was seen in cells infected with poliovirus or rhinoviruses treated with tamoxifen or treated with rapamycin ( see figure 2 ) to examine further whether the membranes induced during poliovirus infection display additional characteristics of autophagosomes we employed fluorescent staining with mdc under specific fixation conditions mdc is retained in autophagosomal membranes 5455 as shown in figure 4 treatment of mcf7 human breast tumor cells with tamoxifen caused the accumulation of punctate structures that retained staining with mdc after fixation similar punctate staining was observed in cells infected for 5 h with rhinovirus 14 ( figure 4a ) or for 3 h or more with poliovirus ( see figure 4b ) to test the hypothesis that the mdc stained structures observed in figure 4 were the same as the gfp lc3 containing structures observed in figure 2 we monitored the localization of gfp lc3 with mdc as a live stain mdc is a poor marker for autophagosomes because both autophagic membranes and lysosomes are visualized 46 however if cells are subjected to a defined fixation protocol after staining with mdc the dye can be removed from single membraned but not double membraned vesicles 5455 as shown in figure 5 good colocalization of mdc and lc3 was observed in poliovirus infected cells and no evidence of the punctate mdc staining expected of lysosomal membranes could be seen in uninfected cells to determine whether the autophagosome like membranes induced during poliovirus infection perform an antiviral function or facilitate viral replication we tested the effect on poliovirus yield of pretreating h1 hela cells with either tamoxifen or rapamycin known inducers of autophagy yield of intracellular virus increased approximately 4 fold when cells were pretreated with tamoxifen and 3 fold upon pretreatment with rapamycin ( figure 6a and 6b ) conversely when cells were treated with 3 methyladenine a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy 56 yield of intracellular virus was decreased ( figure 6c ) therefore during poliovirus infection the activity of the autophagy pathway correlates with productive viral replication not with viral destruction to extend the studies with pharmacological agents we tested the effect of reducing the amount of intracellular autophagy proteins lc3 and atg12p on poliovirus yield using double stranded rna oligonucleotides designed to target their mrnas for destruction by rna interference pools of double stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized to target atg12 mrna and to target both lc3a and lc3b mrnas ( see materials and methods ) as shown in figure 7 the intracellular abundance of atg12p and lc3 proteins could be reduced to 70 and 90 respectively of their abundance in cells treated with control double stranded small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) known to target firefly luciferase mrna these reductions in atg12p and lc3 protein concentration resulted in 3 fold and 4 fold reductions respectively in yields of intracellular poliovirus even stronger effects of the rna interference ( rnai ) mediated reduction in autophagy proteins on viral yield were observed however when the yields of extracellular virus were examined the effects of rnai against atg12 and lc3 on extracellular virus were 9 fold and 20 fold respectively ( figure 7 ) two potential mechanisms for this preferential reduction in extracellular as opposed to intracellular virus seemed possible the first possibility was that the rnai mediated reductions in the intracellular concentrations of atg12p and lc3 protein reduced cell lysis and therefore lytic release of virus links between autophagy and apoptosis have been reported ( reviewed in 5758 ) the possibility of decreased cellular susceptibility to lysis upon rnai treatment is difficult to exclude however early cell lysis in the presence of reduced atg12p or lc3 concentrations seemed unlikely because the amounts of virus released were very small and the observed reductions in extracellular virus release were seen at early time points before lysis was expected a second possibility for the greater reduction in extracellular than intracellular virus is that double membraned structures with the cytoplasm provide a topologically reasonable mechanism for nonlytic release of cytoplasmic contents ultrastructural analysis studies of cells infected with poliovirus 12 and with rhinovirus 14 ( figure 8a ) have revealed the presence of virions and other cytoplasmic material within the lumen of double membraned vesicles presumably these are double membraned vesicles that formed relatively late in infection and were therefore able to trap viruses already present in the nearby cytoplasm the known proximity of rna replication protein expression and virion packaging to the membrane associated replication complexes 5960 should facilitate such events figure 8b displays an image consistent with the release of the packets of cytosol expected if the outer bilayer of a multilamellar membrane structure were to fuse with the plasma membrane figure 8c shows that in poliovirus infected cells such blebs can contain lc3 and figure 8d shows that they can also contain vp1 a viral capsid protein in this work we have shown that several hallmarks of cellular autophagosomes including the localization of gfp lc3 into discrete punctate structures and staining with mdc followed by fixation can be observed in human cells whether they are treated with tamoxifen or infected with poliovirus or rhinovirus furthermore we have employed a new criterion for autophagy the colocalization of lc3 and lamp1 to demonstrate that this intracellular rearrangement was observed in cells treated with tamoxifen infected with picornaviruses ( poliovirus rhinovirus 2 or rhinovirus 14 ) or transfected with plasmids that express poliovirus proteins 2bc and 3a ( see figures 2 and 8 ) taken together with the previously observed double membraned morphology cytoplasmic contents and complex origin of the membranous structures induced during poliovirus infection 1235 we argue that the viruses utilize components of the autophagosome formation pathway to form the characteristic double membraned vesicles seen during infection do the autophagosome like membranous structures induced by poliovirus act as scaffolds for rna replication or are they part of the host antiviral response the numerous positive correlations between the functional presence of autophagosomal pathways and increased viral yield lead us to conclude that the autophagosome like structures observed during poliovirus infection are not antiviral instead we argue that the double membraned vesicles induced during poliovirus infection facilitate poliovirus replication and we hypothesize that poliovirus rhinovirus 2 and rhinovirus 14 subvert the constituents of the cellular autophagy pathway to form membranous scaffolds on which rna replication complexes can assemble other positive strand rna viruses that have been shown to localize their rna replication complexes to double membraned vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells are equine artirivirus 61 murine hepatitis virus 62 and sars virus 63 the membranes associated with murine hepatitis virus infection have been shown recently to contain lc3 protein 64 strikingly infection of murine es cell lines deficient for apg5 with murine hepatitis virus was shown to result in a large decrease in the extracellular yield of this enveloped virus the effect on intracellular viral particles or rna was not reported nevertheless the large reduction in yield of extracellular virus seen in the absence of atg5p protein argues that this component of the cellular autophagy pathway is crucial for some step in the formation or egress of infectious virions of this murine coronavirus 64 for both poliovirus and equine artirivirus molecular inducers of double membraned vesicle formation have been identified specifically coexpression of poliovirus proteins 2bc and 3a is required to accumulate double membraned vesicles 35 and to elicit the colocalization of gfp lc3 and lamp1 that correlates with the formation of autophagosomes ( see figure 3a ) for equine artirivirus the coexpression of viral proteins nsp2 and nsp3 is sufficient to induce the formation of double membraned vesicles 65 we anticipate that these viral proteins likely to be capable of mimicking intercepting or corrupting the pathway of cellular autophagy will prove to be useful tools to decipher its mechanism recent work has highlighted an important role for autophagy in the innate immune response of vertebrates to intracellular pathogens for example induction of autophagy has been shown to promote clearance of mycobacterium tuberculosis from infected macrophage 66 furthermore during infection with shigella flexneri the wild type function of the bacterial icsb gene was shown to be required to prevent autophagic degradation a process that the authors argue is specifically induced by a bacterial protein the product of the virg gene 67 like s flexneri successful microorganisms often display strategies to evade potent host defenses furthermore some microorganisms actively subvert otherwise effective host defense responses for their own benefit for example the growth of mink focus forming virus requires apoptotic caspase activity for the maturation of a nonstructural protein 68 and murine cytomegalovirus encodes a chemokine homolog to attract cells of the immune system to the site of infection which then promote viral dissemination ( reviewed in 69 ) similarly precedents are beginning to be established in which the autophagic pathway or its constituents may be subverted by intracellular pathogens to benefit their own replication ( reviewed in 4243 ) as shown in figure 9 the pathway of autophagosome formation ends with the acquisition of the lysosomal proteases and lipases that render the autophagosome a degradative organelle 2728 mature autolysosomes are no longer bounded by double membranes because the inner membrane and luminal contents are degraded becoming electron dense and compact 24 in legionella infection several genes termed dot or icm genes are required to retard the progression of autophagosome maturation presumably to benefit bacterial growth within organelles that subvert components of the autophagosome 707172 we argue that poliovirus rhinovirus 2 rhinovirus 14 equine encephalitis virus 65 and murine hepatitis virus 64 have similarly evolved a mechanism to accumulate autophagosome like membranes in the cytoplasm for the duration of the infection to maintain most of these structures in their double membraned form viral infection may both induce their formation and prevent their maturation into degradative organelles why would a virus choose a double membraned autophagosome like vesicle on which to replicate its rna not all positive strand rna viruses utilize such structures for example flock house virus rna replication complexes assemble on outer mitochondrial membranes 73 when the rna replication complexes of a subgenomic flock house virus rna were experimentally redirected to the cytoplasmic surface of the er of s cerevisiae the yield of replicated rna actually increased 73 therefore viral rna replication displayed no mitochondrion specific requirement for specific lipids proteins or processes presumably however there are reasons why particular positive strand rna viruses target particular intracellular membranes on which to assemble their replication complexes some of which might not be assayed under single cycle growth conditions in tissue culture a larger effect on extracellular than intracellular virus yield was observed when the abundance of autophagy proteins atg12p and lc3 was reduced by rnai ( see figure 7 ) possible explanations for the observed preferential decrease in extracellular virions are that the reduction in autophagosome machinery decreased cell lysis early in infection or that reduced abundance of autophagosomal machinery decreased nonlytic viral escape although our data do not yet distinguish between these hypotheses we will discuss the latter possibility because nonlytic delivery of cytosol to the extracellular milieu could be a unique characteristic of multilamellar vesicles and we were able to obtain ultrastructural images consistent with this interpretation ( see figure 8 ) nominally lytic viruses are often assumed to spread exclusively via cell lysis however the possibility of nonlytic viral release even for nonenveloped viruses such as poliovirus has been suggested from numerous reports of persistently infected cell lines that continuously secreted infectious particles 74757677 even more convincingly when polarized caco 2 cultures growing as intact monolayers as shown by resistance to the passage of dyes and electric current between the apical and basolateral surfaces were infected with poliovirus newly synthesized virus was shown to emerge from only the apical surface 78 that the egress of this virus did not correspond to a detectable breach in the monolayer argued that a nonlytic and polarized exit route of unknown origin had been utilized we suggest a potential mechanism for this nonlytic release of cytosolic viral particles via the formation of double membraned vesicles throughout the course of infection early in infection the double membraned structures would entrap cytosol but this cytosol would be free of virions however at later stages of infection the cytosol trapped by newly generated double membraned structures would often contain viral particles poliovirions and related enteroviruses are relatively resistant to the low ph and active proteolysis that would prevail within the lumen of these vesicles should they mature 7980 as depicted in figure 9 the fusion of the outer membrane of an intact double membraned structure would result in the release of membrane bound packets of cytoplasm into the extracellular milieu whereas fusion of the membrane of a mature autophagosome would result in the direct release of cytosolic contents and incompletely resolved double membrane structures would result in the formation of more complex topologies the presence of both lc3 and poliovirus capsid protein vp1 in extracellular structures adjacent to poliovirus infected cells ( see figure 8c and 8d ) is consistent with the release of at least partially intact packets of cytoplasm during poliovirus infection we speculate that the formerly intracellular membranes surrounding these packets of cytoplasm would be short lived outside the cell with free virus being the eventual result recently hiv has been shown to exit human macrophages via the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane rather than by directly budding from the cell surface as in hiv infected t cells 818283 hiv gag protein directs the targeting of hiv particles to multivesicular bodies via direct binding to cellular protein tsg101 8485 a component of the escrt complex required for the sorting of proteins into endosomes 868788 similarly the intracellular formation of double membraned vesicles in poliovirus infected cells provides a topologically reasonable mechanism for the extracellular delivery of cytosolic contents in the absence of cell lysis we speculate that a mechanism to spread virus within tissues of infected hosts without cell lysis could provide an advantage to those positive strand viruses that subvert constituents of the cellular pathway of autophagosome formation poliovirus mahoney type 1 was isolated following transfection with an infectious cdna 89 and propagated as previously described 34 tet off mcf7 cells were obtained from clontech ( palo alto california united states ) and propagated in dmem + 10 fbs mcf7 cells are highly inducible for autophagosome formation in response to tamoxifen 9 poliovirus stocks were titered on both hela h1 and mcf7 cells the multiplicities of infections indicated refer to titers on the appropriate cell lines h1 hela cells were used due to their permissiveness for rhinovirus infection rhinovirus stocks were obtained from the american type culture collection ( atcc manassas virginia united states ) virus stocks were prepared in h1 hela cells ( atcc ) grown in emem supplemented with 0 2 m hepes and 0 1 m mgcl2 and viral titers were measured by tcid50 as described previously 90 to construct the gfp lc3 fusion protein expressing plasmid lc3b sequences were amplified by pcr from a human lung library ( resgen carlsbad california united states ) using targeted primers containing ecori sites (

respiratory syndrome ( sars ) epidemic on childbirth in taiwan,,the first probable case of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in taiwan was identified on march 14 2003 1 the epidemic became elevated at the end of april and reached its peak in may and june finally the epidemic ended when taiwan was officially removed from the world health organization ( who ) list of sars affected countries on july 5 2003 1 3 the fear of sars spread over all of taiwan and was mainly directed at those regional hospitals and medical centers where outbreaks had occurred and where sars patients were being treated peoples fears originated with the novelty of the disease its rapid nosocomial transmission and the apparent vulnerability of hospitals and health care workers many people started to wonder whether the overwhelming fears of sars directed at the regional hospitals and medical centers changed a patients care seeking behavior and even physicians treatment patterns and thereby had possible health consequences especially for those whose survival or state of health depended on routine and / or continuous medical care delivery of a child is a classic example under normal circumstances distance and quality are believed to be two major determinants in a patients choice for obstetrics care 4 7 in this study we sought to estimate the influence of peoples fears of sars on peoples choice of provider mode of child delivery and length of hospital stay before during and after the delivery the peoples fears include fears of patients and fears of doctors as choice of mode of delivery and length of stay tend to be a joint decision the fears of doctors to sars may also reduce cesarean section rate and shorten the length of stay for lowering the possibility of acquiring sars considering the fact that hospital levels 58 15 ( mode of delivery 1617 and length of maternity stay 18 25 are significantly associated with postpartum maternal and neo natal health status the question whether the fears of sars led patients to transfer from a more advanced hospital to a less advanced hospital becomes an important quality of care concern health consequences resulting from these behavioral changes due to peoples fears of sars should not be overlooked 26 29 the results could provide public health agencies an important reference when assessing the consequences of the sars epidemic on quality of care so that when sars re emerges or other similar new infectious disease emerges it can guide obstetricians and public health professionals to prevent avoidable health consequences because of peoples fears concerning these new and strongly infectious diseases since its implementation in march 1995 the national health insurance ( nhi ) program provides a mandatory and comprehensive universal health care coverage for all taiwanese residents for obstetrics care a wide range of services including pre natal delivery and neo natal care are extensively covered under the nhi program both vaginal and cesarean deliveries are covered and no co insurance is required for child delivery the program offers patients complete freedom of choice among providers and methods of delivery in order to contain the in patient costs for western medical services the nhi program has instituted the case payment method for 50 clearly defined medical conditions and they include both vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery case payment is similar to the drg ( diagnosis related groups ) payment system in the u s it bundles itemized medical services essential for each condition and provides financial incentives for a more efficient delivery process the case payment system reimburses the provider on a per case basis and the payment varies by accreditation level of the provider it also assumes that the complexity or quality of care also varies by provider level the current accreditation system categorizes medical institutions into 4 levels from most advanced to most basic medical center regional hospital district hospital and clinic the accreditation criteria include infrastructure capacity manpower volume management and administrative processes for vaginal delivery the case payment ranges from nt $ 17420 per case in medical centers to nt $ 15100 per case in clinics for cesarean delivery the range is larger ( from nt $ 32330 per case in medical centers to nt $ 27170 per case in clinics ) furthermore the national health insurance law prohibits its contracted providers from any direct / extra billing for any service covered by the nhi program this study conducted a population based descriptive analysis of changes in market share cesarean rate and length of maternity stay for each of the four levels of provider before during and after the sars epidemic this study retrieved all 448365 nhi in patient claims for childbirth from january 01 2002 to december 31 2003 vaginal deliveries were those coded with the nhi case payment drg 0373a and 0373c cesarean deliveries were those coded with the nhi case payment drg 0371a and 0373b each claim cites the patient provider diagnoses treatment procedures mode of delivery and admission and discharge dates a unique provider identification number was used to link the nhi provider file which identifies provider accreditation level as the sars epidemic started in march elevated in may and finally ended in july we divided the study period into 5 sub periods pre sars period from january 2002 to february 2003 ( t0 ) initial sars period from march 2003 to april 2003 ( t1 ) peak sars period from may 2003 to june 2003 ( t2 ) final sars period from july 2003 to august 2003 ( t3 ) and post sars period from september 2003 to december 2003 ( t4 ) monthly average estimates for market share cesarean rate length of maternity stay all by accreditation level were calculated and expressed in numbers and percentages mean differences in average cesarean rate and average length of maternity stay between the pre sars and the peak periods ( t2 t0 ) and between the pre sars and post sars periods ( t4 t0 ) were determined by 2 tailed t tests the data were managed and analyzed by using sas version 8 2 all analyses were tested for significance by using an alpha of 05 since no human participants were involved no irb approval is necessary the confidentiality assurances were addressed by abiding the data regulations of the bureau of national health insurance which stipulated the data only for use of this research figure 1 shows the changes in the market share of delivery services by accreditation level of provider in the five sub periods in terms of market share before the sars epidemic although clinics still had the largest market share they were slowly losing their share to their powerful competitors the medical centers and the regional hospitals however peoples fears of sars reversed this situation during the sars epidemic as patients switched to clinics during the sars epidemic to deliver their child rather than in the larger academic medical centers and regional hospitals a dramatic drop in market share was observed for both the medical centers and the regional hospitals during the sars epidemic while at the same time both district hospitals and clinics gained market share in addition table 1 shows the changes in monthly average number of deliveries and the market share of delivery services by accreditation level of provider in the 3 key sub periods ( pre sars peak sars and post sars periods ) generally speaking over the past several years taiwan has experienced a constant decreasing fertility rate on average there were 2189 fewer deliveries each month during the peak sars period than during the pre sars period compared to the pre sars period ( t0 ) medical centers and regional hospitals dropped 5 2 and 4 1 in market shared during the peak sars period ( t2 ) but district hospitals and clinics increased 2 1 and 7 1 respectively although medical centers and regional hospitals regained some of their lost market share during the post sars period ( t4 ) they still did not fully regain their market shares at the pre sars level ( medical centers 2 0 regional hospitals 0 8 ) table 2 compares the changes in monthly average cesarean section rates and length of stay ( los ) in the pre peak and post sars periods ( t0 t2 and t4 ) compared to the pre sars period we observed only a marginal decrease in overall cesarean rate ( 1 0 ) but a significantly larger increase in cesarean rate in medical centers ( 2 2 ) and significantly decrease in clinics ( 1 9 ) during the peak sars period ( t2 ) one plausible explanation is that as normal or less complicated deliveries shifted to lower level hospitals or clinics those cases that remained in the medical centers tended to be complicated ones which required cesarean sections hence although women shifted their place of delivery from higher level hospitals to lower level hospitals / clinics due to a greater risk of exposure to sars at these higher level hospitals their choice of delivery method did not seem to change in addition the average cesarean section rate in medical centers returned to the pre sars level during the post sars period while the cesarean section rates in lower level hospitals and clinics showed the opposite the cesarean section rates in regional district hospitals and clinics dropped significantly during the post sars period from their levels before the sars epidemic furthermore table 2 and figure 2 present changes in average los among different provider levels as expected in order to reduce their potential risk of exposure to sars people tried to minimize their maternal stay in a hospital as much as possible the overall average length of stay decreased from 3 40 days to 3 25 days from the pre sars period ( t0 ) to the peak sars period ( t2 ) and then returned to 3 39 days after the sars epidemic ( t4 ) more specifically significant reductions in average los were observed in all hospital levels except for clinics at t2 average length of stay was shortened by 0 21 days in medical centers ( 5 6 ) 0 21 days in regional hospitals ( 5 8 ) and 0 13 days in district hospitals ( 3 8 ) average los in clinics remained basically unchanged however as soon as the sars epidemic ended average los in most hospitals and clinics not only returned to the pre sars level but became slightly longer than it was prior to sars which is not significant statistically speaking our results based on a population based study demonstrate that if the use of medical care required was essential and could not be deferred such as childbirth the fears of sars including both fears of patients and fears of doctors had a significant influence on patients preference for provider and on their length of in patient stay however it did not necessarily influence their choice of therapies during the sars epidemic even though the sars influence upon a patients decision regarding the length of stay ended with the end of the epidemic the fear of sars remained influential on how people chose their place of delivery during the sars epidemic large amounts of patients shifting from more advanced hospitals to less advanced hospitals and substantially reducing their length of maternity stay simply out of fear could result in a serious concern for quality of care especially for a patients accessibility to quality care and the continuity of that care for example patients transferring to a less advanced hospital could severely compromise their access to more sophisticated technologies and interrupt their continuity of care this in turn could endanger the lives of the mothers and their babies 58 14 ( significantly shorter length of stay increases the risk of a premature discharge and compromise the quality of care which again could lead to adverse health outcomes for both mother and baby 23 2530 furthermore not only the physicians who may directly encounter with sars patients need to be alert and better trained for this type of outbreak obstetricians should also be aware and extremely cautious about suddenly substantial patient shift and strong demand of shorter length of maternity stay posed by the publics fear of such an outbreak as these sudden changes in peoples behaviors are likely to hinder patients continuity of care and cause adverse maternal and neonatal health consequences it is essential for obstetricians to be well prepared to deal with these consequences during an outbreak a few study limitations should be noted first due to data and time constraints this study only shows the immediate impacts of the fears of sars on the shifting of patients from one facility to another as well as their length of stay this study cannot confirm whether these changes led to any long term adverse maternity or perinatal outcomes if in the post sars period mothers and childs morbidity and mortality remained the same the residual increase of child births in clinics and district hospitals would be a positive impact since it reduces health care costs without compromising health outcomes future research with a longer post sars observational period and more detailed maternal and perinatal outcome information could help to advance our knowledge in this regard second the significant amount of patient shifting observed among provider levels suggests that the fear of sars changed peoples preference as to their choice of provider during the sars epidemic whether this influence will persist remains to be seen third since we only focused on childbirth in this study the results may not be generalizable to other medical conditions patient behavior may very well differ for medical conditions / diseases with different levels of severity and / or medical urgency furthermore the influence of the fear of sars on other important patient behaviors such as their decision to seek care or not during the sars epidemic if their medical needs could be deferred or suspended to a later time remains uncertain there are many questions that remain to be answered concerning the possible impacts of sars on various aspects of health care in terms of policy implications the medical centers and regional hospitals in taiwan took on the majority of the responsibility in caring for the more severe sars cases and by doing so lost their market share to district hospitals and clinics because of peoples fear of sars the bnhi negotiated with these hospitals to compensate them for their loss of revenue during the sars epidemic and bring it up to the previous years level it is expected that by minimizing a hospitals financial loss it will increase that hospitals willingness to admit sars patients and secure peoples access to proper medical care in the likelihood of a re emergence of a sars epidemic or any other pandemic strategies which help to restore peoples confidence in those hospitals that have admitted sars patients should be part of the long term solution finally while internationally all of the global attention is focused on the direct causalities of sars serious quality of care concerns resulting from peoples behavioral changes due to their fears of sars should not be overlooked taiwans experience could provide valuable lessons to other countries in assessing full impacts of the sars epidemic and help to

p34ezktf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1087471/,"vivian lin, priscilla robinson",australian public health policy in 2003 2004,,while early global anxiety over sars occupied headlines between february and may the more persistent popular headline in 2003 focused on obesity summits were held in nsw and victoria while the national obesity taskforce was convened under the auspice of the australian health ministers council ( ahmc ) when kay patterson was the federal health minister she declared that prevention was the fourth pillar of medicare and she wanted to be minister for prevention indeed the 2003 / 04 federal budget although limited contained a bundle of initiatives entitled prevention on the health agenda in particular a number of immunisation and health promotion programs were included significant amongst the funding initiatives for public health announced in 2003 / 04 was government support for the meningococcal vaccine although this was the culmination of many months of careful planning a perception existed that this only occurred after considerable public interest in and anxiety about deaths from outbreaks of this disease further changes to the recommended schedule in 2003 were made by the australian technical advisory group on immunisation ( atagi ) in particular the inclusion of pneumococcal and varicella vaccines however these did not result in similar prescribed vaccine programs or in similar funding these three developments are reviewed in greater detail in the next section the national public health partnership ( nphp ) and the ahmc adopted the influenza pandemic plan in october 2003 and with the advent of the newly identified disease sars as well as outbreaks of meningococcal disease management and prevention of communicable diseases was prominent following on from the significant funding boost for bioterrorism preparedness in 2002 / 03 public health preparedness became a more generic theme the arrival of sars occupied the national popular and political imagination as well as tested the infrastructure capacity of public health australia fared well during the outbreak apart from escaping with only six australian cases it provided an opportunity to establish a coordinated approach between the commonwealth and the states / territories and also contributed to the global epidemiological investigation and prevention effort sars also prompted amendments to the quarantine act 4 while the recall following the pan pharmaceutical crisis put the therapeutic goods administration ( tga ) under the spotlight it also managed to conclude negotiations that had been in train for several years on a trans tasman regulatory regime and authority also on the regulatory front the australian new zealand food regulation ministerial council endorsed a nutrition health and related claims policy guidelines and established a review of genetically modified ( gm ) labeling of foods 5 all these developments pointed to the global nature of public health and the intersection between public health activities and the economy policy development in public health has never been confined to a set of health programs and in 2003 / 04 the lead was often taken from outside the health sector most significant was the adoption of the national agenda for early childhood 6 pushed by public health advocates for child health since the mid 1990s the national public health partnership responded by coordinating a scoping of child health strategies across australia elsewhere in government promoting and maintaining good health was adopted as one of the national research priorities 7 healthy ageing also emerged as a policy theme in ageing research public health workforce development was pursued outside the mainstream education and training arrangements for public health in universities the community services and health training board commissioned a consultative process to develop population health competencies for the vocational education and training ( vet ) sector 8 new population health qualifications and competencies were proposed for incorporation into the health training package including certificates in population health and in environmental health and diplomas in population health and in indigenous environmental health the release in 2003 of the report returns on investments in public health an epidemiological and economic analysis 9 ( often referred to as the abelson report ) may have a significant impact in subsequent years commissioned several years earlier by the population health division of the department of health and ageing ( doha ) the report experienced a relatively low profile until derek wanless visited from the uk having chaired a review that contributed to a significant budgetary increase for the nhs wanless had been commissioned by the british treasury to examine prevention across government in september 2003 at a meeting in canberra with senior officials across key agencies wanless marveled at the value of the abelson report described in more detail below although 2004 was an election year public health policy was neither visible during the campaign or in policy development more generally the federal governments initiative to wind up the national occupational health and safety commission received little publicity and comment even though it indicated the commonwealths increasing tendency to pursue its own pathway separate from states and territories and to bring the functions of statutory bodies into departments jurisdictional and annual reports show that across the states and territories there were multiple plans draft guidelines meetings episodic training and programs across a broad range of areas some health issues are being taken up across jurisdictions particularly tobacco control sexually transmitted infections aboriginal health and vaccination innovative activities were reported in some jurisdictions such as a new health impact assessment branch and a new public health training program in western australia there was however no apparent consistency in health priorities across the nation and an apparent divergence in the interests of the states / territories and the federal government while the prevention and management of overweight and obesity agenda may have appeared to many observers as a new issue in 2003 its arrival was preceded by several years of intensive work the nhmrc had released acting on australias weight strategic plan for the prevention of overweight and obesity in 1997 10 the same year the abs published the findings from the 1995 national nutrition survey revealing that 45 of men and 29 of women in australia were overweight with an additional 18 of men and women classified as obese 11 furthermore overweight and obesity were more common in lower socio economic groups in rural populations in some immigrant groups and in aboriginal and torres strait islander ( atsi ) peoples despite longstanding national cooperation on nutrition ( since the days of the national better health program in the late 1980s ) and even more recent national cooperation on physical activity public and political imagination was not captured until the same issues were recast as obesity with a focus in particular on childhood obesity following from the nsw childhood obesity summit in late 2002 the australian health ministers agreed that a national approach was required and established a national obesity taskforce 12 in 2003 nsw health released its response to the summit recommendations and supported the vast majority of the 145 resolutions 13 the victorian department of human services also held a summit 14 while healthy weight 2008 australias future was released by the commonwealth 15 the nhmrc joined in with release in late 2003 of clinical practice guidelines for general practitioners and other health professionals 16 while the specifics vary the major themes and strategies are captured in healthy weight 2008 these are summarised in the table 1 the commonwealth strategy is however relatively weak on intersectoral policy and regulatory measures as an illustrative example of the contrast at the state level implementation in nsw now ranges from school physical activity and nutrition survey to a school canteen strategy to negotiating with commercial television australia about their code of practice on advertising in peak childrens viewing hours the commonwealth apparently chose not to consider how it might exercise its relevant taxation or legislative powers despite the history of health promotion pointing to the importance of public policy measures beyond the health system an examination of the manner in which the obesity issue was framed and the details contained in the national strategy raises a number of issues and questions why was framing the issues as obesity more successful than the focus on nutrition and physical activity why did obesity gain traction while the other terms did not why did the commonwealth opt for the softer programmatic approach rather than tackle obesity with stronger public policy measures ( such as taxation and regulation ) and demonstrate its national leadership capacity was the absence of stronger public policy measures because obesity is regarded as largely a health issue rather than a whole of government issue or was the government waiting to see if the us opposed the who global strategy on account of the strength of the industry lobby after a number of years of public concern about eating disorders and whether they arise in part because of promotion of certain types of body image was the obesity label a backward step for mental health and a return to traditional images of beauty is there a risk that people including children who are labeled as overweight and obese will be stigmatised to what extent have the voices of affected communities been incorporated into the development of national strategies if at all given the correlation between obesity and socioeconomic disadvantage how would the proposed strategy not exacerbate those inequalities were children targeted because they are a captive audience and therefore easy targets or did the evidence suggest the best return on investment ( in terms of health gain and managing demand on the health care system ) would come from a focus on children was the move to appeal to a populist agenda while simultaneously progressing the longer term agenda of tackling health inequalities through multi sectoral partnerships a triumph for public health advocates these complex threads are interwoven for the moment the publicly enunciated agenda represents a confluence of a number of rationales the 2002 / 2003 federal budget papers stated that the government is committed to making disease prevention and health promotion a fundamental pillar of the health system however this was not evident in the subsequent 2003 / 2004 budget the governments focus on prevention package in 2002 / 03 aimed to incorporate disease prevention into the core business of the primary health care system and was reflective of how the public health agenda was evolving at the national level 24 the package was comprised largely of a range of measures directed at specific diseases plus a bundle of initiatives for general practitioners also referred to as the primary health care system amongst health conditions affecting australians breast cancer received the most attention with the national breast cancer centre being funded to develop a partnership approach to the review and dissemination of new information along with information support and management initiatives for rural women diagnosed with breast cancer hepatitis c also received some attention with funding for national education and prevention projects financial support was offered for the sars efforts that had been undertaken by states and territories in particular for providing medical personnel at international airports a clear process for assessing priorities under the broad banded national public health program was also flagged for purposes of the budget primary health care was defined as general practitioners and the measures funded included lifestyle prescriptions to help gps raise community awareness and understanding of benefits of preventive health collaborative approach to learning training education and support systems coordinated care plans for people with chronic or terminal conditions and involvement in multidisciplinary case conferencing the budget did not adopt a comprehensive approach to the primary health care system perhaps because many community health services which represent the other important arm for delivery of public health services are the responsibility of states the timetable for renewing public health outcome funding agreements ( phofas ) between the commonwealth and states and territories in 2004 raised in the minds of some stakeholders the possibility that the commonwealth might adopt a more comprehensive and strategic approach linking public health and primary health care funding streams judging by the actual quantum of funds made available in the 2003 / 2004 budget it would seem that most elements from the package did not actually receive additional funding as shown in table 3 indeed many of the gp initiatives previously cast as improving primary health care were subsequently packaged as prevention the combination of these measures reflected a tight fiscal climate with little growth in the overall health budget as well as that of other portfolios it was also a package that demonstrated relatively limited imagination with support for established issues ( such as breast cancer ) and re packaging general practice measures that were already in train with medicare spending uncapped ( and targeted public health programs capped ) attaining more prevention dollars through the gp sector may appear to be one of the few ways to grow dollars for prevention although this could be considered to be consistent with the ottawa charter of reorienting health services many gps are not trained in a population based approach to practice and simply providing new for payments to all represents an undifferentiated uncoordinated and untargeted approach to prevention if there is limited support to gps and little monitoring then these measures are unlikely to translate into improved health outcomes meanwhile the strategic framework for chronic disease prevention adopted by the national public health partnership in 2001 still lacked a policy and budgetary response in 2003 / 04 and in 2004 / 05 while states / territories adopting varying measures singly funding for the tough on drugs strategy was announced outside the focus on prevention package perhaps due to the fact that the tough on drugs was the responsibility of the parliamentary secretary therefore requiring a separate communications strategy or because the prime minister has a strong personal interest in the illicit drug strategy the range of measures funded ( which included introduction of retractable needle and syringe technology addressing problems related to increased availability and use of psycho stimulants establishing a research fund supporting alcohol and drug workforce development needs promoting access to drug treatment in rural areas and tackling problems faced by drug users with concurrent mental health problems ) certainly suggested more serious government interest and commitment to illicit drugs the 2004 / 05 budget indicated the federal governments agenda in public health had narrowed considerably $ 33 million new funding was announced for measures to address emerging risks ( such as emergency medicines stockpile disease surveillance and public health laboratories health security legislation and incidence response ) but only $ 5 2 million new funding was made available for promotion of healthy lifestyles related to national health priorities ( for addressing such as tobacco alcohol drugs injury and cancer ) 25 during the course of the howard government there has been a gradual process of re casting the landscape of interest groups and policy constituencies strong support for breast cancer and zero tolerance on illicit drugs contrasts sharply with the delays experienced in renewal of the national hiv / hepatitis c strategy the new prominence given to meningococcal vaccine child health and obesity creates space for other interest groups even if the re framing was shaped by nutrition and physical activity lobbies other clinical interests have been brought into the picture these developments illustrate how political considerations are important in determining public health policy it was interesting however to observe the interest in prevention from outside the health portfolio particularly from treasury this was motivated in part by the intergenerational report and concerns about both the sustainability of medicare as well as the social and economic cost burden arising from an ageing society this helped to ensure interest in the abelson report 9 few countries have conducted research on return of investment from prevention efforts australia was praised by derek wanless at a high level consultation for completing such an analysis during his visit to canberra while conducting a review for the uk treasury securing good health for the whole population 26 his final report pointed to australia and netherlands as two countries that were increasingly using economic evaluation in public health programs it will be interesting to see if public health policy analysts and treasury officials draw on this report in future years in the future it will be interesting to see if the focus on high visibility programs can demonstrate short term economic returns given 2004 was an election year the political economy of prevention programs could arguably have become a focus of future public health policy with the 2003 / 4 agenda providing the government with the opportunity to gauge public reaction to this new positioning and design their election campaign appropriately this was however not the case the american emphasis on preparedness appears not to resonate with the australian public in the same way from the perspective of public health policy advocates some lessons that can be drawn from 2003 / 04 are governments response to public health proposals are shaped by its understanding of the popular interest and desire to communicate directly with the general public longer term public health issues which have struggled to gain support can be progressed if they are cleverly shaped to fit the governments formula develop and nurture new advocates particularly in seeking to engage with the broader health system and work with the media as partners rather than adversaries these lessons need to be learned well and quickly to assist with moving the forum for public health policy debate more into the public domain beyond an essentially in
